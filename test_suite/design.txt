#Dates of elev2D.th.nc should agree with run start date
#Average tide level in elev2D.th.nc should be sensible for NAVD88 tides on shelf

#Suisun gate flash should be closed always when boatlock open
#Suisun flash should be closed when tidally operating
#Suisun gate radial operation should be at most briefly fully closed. In pseudo code
    both_closed = (radial.open == 0) & (radial.closed == 0)
	assert total_annual(both_closed) < 7days

#Hotstart should have no nans
#Vgrid should have no grid locations with zero layers
#Options in param.nml/bctides etc should consistently point to tropic or clinic
#hgrid.ll check order of lat and lon. using local values
#No gate th detritis: files should not be present with names that look like Delta gates if not present
#Can we check CCF?

Incomplete ideas:
#Nudging should point to consistent file suffix.
#can we internalize an ipre=1 launch and parse output?

[DONE]
