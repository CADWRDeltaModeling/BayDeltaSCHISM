	abstract = {The gravitational exchange of two fluids with different densities between reservoirs connected by a channel of constant depth and slowly varying breadth is analysed as a problem of internal hydraulics. It is shown that maximal two-way exchange with a net barotropic flow requires the presence of two controls, one at the narrrowest section and a second or ‘virtual’ control lying to one side of the narrowest section. The two controls are connected by a subcritical region, but are separated from subcritical conditions in the reservoirs by supercritical flow and stationary internal bores. Solutions are found for maximal exchange without a net barotropic component, in which case the problem is similar to that first examined by Stommel \& Farmer (1953). The Stommel \& Farmer analysis is shown to be a rather special limiting example of submaximal exchange, not generally applicable to natural flows. The addition of a net barotropic flow yields a range of different flow types, including maximal exchange, one-layer baroclinic flow, one-layer barotropic flow, submaximal flow governed by a reservoir condition and two-layer unidirectional flow. The maximal-exchange solution is integrated for periodic barotropic flow.},

	abstract = {This is a theoretical and experimental study of the basic hydraulics of two flowing layers. Unlike single-layer flows, two-layer flows respond quite differently to bottom depth as opposed to width variations. Bottom-depth changes affect the lower layer directly and the upper layer only indirectly. Changes in width can affect both layers. In fact for flows through a contraction control two distinct flow configurations are possible; which one actually occurs depends on the requirements of matching a downstream flow. Two-layer flows can pass through internally critical conditions at other than the narrowest section. When the two layers are flowing in the same direction, the result is a strong coupling between the two layers in the neighbourhood of the control. For contractions a particularly simple flow then exists upstream in which there is no longer any significant interfacial dynamics; downstream in the divergent section the flow remains internally supercritical, causing one of the layers to be rapidly accelerated with a resulting instability at the interface. A brief discussion of internal hydraulic jumps based upon the energy equations as opposed to the more traditional momentum equations is included. Previous uniqueness problems are thereby avoided.},

	abstract = {In this paper we consider domain decomposition methods for solving the radial basis function interpolation equations. There are three interwoven threads to the paper. The ﬁrst thread provides good ways of setting up and solving small- to medium-sized radial basis function interpolation problems. These may occur as subproblems in a domain decomposition solution of a larger interpolation problem. The usual formulation of such a problem can suﬀer from an unfortunate scale dependence not intrinsic in the problem itself. This scale dependence occurs, for instance, when ﬁtting polyharmonic splines in even dimensions. We present and analyze an alternative formulation, available for all strictly conditionally positive deﬁnite basic functions, which does not suﬀer from this drawback, at least for the very important example previously mentioned. This formulation changes the problem into one involving a strictly positive deﬁnite symmetric system, which can be easily and eﬃciently solved by Cholesky factorization. The second section considers a natural domain decomposition method for the interpolation equations and views it as an instance of von Neumann’s alternating projection algorithm. Here the underlying Hilbert space is the reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by the strictly conditionally positive deﬁnite basic function. We show that the domain decomposition method presented converges linearly under very weak nondegeneracy conditions on the possibly overlapping subdomains. The last section presents some algorithmic details and numerical results of a domain decomposition interpolatory code for polyharmonic splines in 2 and 3 dimensions. This code has solved problems with 5 million centers and can ﬁt splines with 10,000 centers in approximately 7 seconds on very modest hardware.},

	abstract = {The accuracy in determining the Lagrangian concentration in the Eulerian±Lagrangian method depends on both the particle tracking algorithm and concentration interpolation. In most existing particle tracking algorithms, accurate tracking cannot be achieved, particularly in a complicated unsteady ¯ow. Also mechanisms for error estimation and accuracy control are not available. A new algorithm is developed by re®ning the process of particle tracking, making use of a series of available travel time increments ({ATTIs}). The {ATTIs} are selected on the basis of tracking accuracy and eciency. These are controlled by practical indices related to the rate of particle velocity variation (magnitude and direction). The particle velocity is determined by bilinear interpolation in space and time. The proposed algorithm combines an inter-element re®nement, consistent with the piecewise interpolation of velocity, and an in-element pathline-based re®nement. No mesh re®nement is needed. Numerical simulations have been used to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. A comparison between the results obtained by using the proposed algorithm and by some existing techniques shows that the new algorithm can provide an accurate and ecient particle tracking, especially in a complicated unsteady heterogeneous ¯ow.

Entry of a tributary into a mainstream ensures detachment of flow from the channel sidewall immediately downstream from the junction, and flume experiments show well-defined relationships between the dimensions of the separation zone and discharge from the tributary. Other things equal, both the width and length of the separation zone increase systematically with an increase in confluence angle, though it is shown that values of width are much less than predicted by recent mathematical modelling. The zone grows at the expense of the proportion of the channel occupied by the immediate post-confluence flow with the consequence that near-bottom velocity increases by a factor of 1.3 as confluence angle is increased from 15°-90°. The implications for sediment entrainment are reviewed briefly.},

The interactions of the large tidal amplitude, currents, river, and wind-generated circulation require baroclinic and unsteady studies to properly understand the estuarine dynamics. Assessment of the model skill has been carried out by model–observation comparisons for salinity, which is the main control for density, surface elevation, current, and turbulence. Stationary nondimensional numbers were only partially able to characterize the dynamics in this (real) complex macrotidal estuary. At low water, tidal straining and constrained river ﬂow cause stratiﬁcation. Large spatial variability occurs in the current and residual patterns, with ﬂood-dominated maximum values occurring within the tidal channels. The tides control residual circulation by modulating stratiﬁcation through tidal straining and bathymetric constraint on river ﬂow. Tide–stratiﬁcation–river interaction causes an unsteady pattern of residual circulation and tidal pulses. River-induced pulses are enhanced near low tide–inducing density-driven circulation. Wind effects are concentrated near the surface, mainly occurring at high tide because of increased fetch. Even though Coriolis has, overall, a small contribution it produces tidal pulses modifying the current and salinity distribution.},

These variations are due largely to the conjunction of a few tidal constituents at adjacent semi-diurnal and quarter-diurnal frequencies rather than timedependent variation in the tidal harmonic constants themselves. Where shallow-water tidal distortions are present, they thus can be modelled by the combination of a semi-diurnal oscillation at the M2 frequency with a quarter-diurnal oscillation at the M4 frequency, given amplitudes and phase angles that reflect time-varying behavior. Indices of tidal asymmetry such as the M4/M2 amplitude ratio vary as a function of time according to this model as revealed by complex demodulation of tidal time series at the M2 and M4 frequencies. The demodulation shows that the amplitude of the quarter-diurnal tide varies approximately as the square of the amplitude of the semi-diurnal tide.},

The magnitude and distribution of open-ocean tide generated storm surge throughout the bay/delta are described by a network of stations within the bay/delta system and along the California coast. Correlation of non-tide water levels between stations in the network indicates that peak storm surge fluctuations propagate into the bay/delta system from outside the Golden Gate. The initial peak surge propagates from the open ocean inland, while a trailing (smaller amplitude) secondary peak is associated with river discharge.

	abstract = {A numerical technique for the modelling of shallow water ow in one and two dimensions is presented in this work along with the results obtained in di erent applications involving unsteady ows in complex geometries. A cell-centred ÿnite volume method based on Roe’s approximate Riemann solver across the edges of both structured and unstructured cells is presented. The discretization of the bed slope source terms is done following an upwind approach. In some applications a problem arises when the ow propagates over adverse dry bed slopes, so a special procedure has been introduced to model the advancing front. It is shown that this modiÿcation reproduces exactly steady state of still water in conÿgurations with strong variations in bed slope and contour. The applications presented are mainly related with unsteady ow problems. The scheme is capable of handling complex ow domains as will be shown in the simulations corresponding to the test cases that are going to be presented. Comparisons of experimental and numerical results are shown for some of the tests. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {In the context of numerical techniques for solving unsteady free surface problems, ﬁnite element and ﬁnite volume approximations are widely used. A class of upwind methods which attempts to model the equations in a genuinely multidimensional manner has been recently introduced as an alternative. Multidimensional upwind schemes ({MUS}) were developed initially for the approximation of steady-state solutions of the two-dimensional Euler equations on unstructured grids, although they can be applicable to any system of hyperbolic conservation laws, such as the shallow water equations. The formal analogy between the two systems of equations is useful for simple cases. However, in practical applications of interest in hydraulics, complex geometries and bottom slope variation can lead to important numerical errors produced by an inadequate source term discretization. This problem has been analyzed and, in this work, the necessity of a multidimensional upwind discretization of the source terms is justiﬁed. The basis of the numerical method is stated and the particular adaptation to unsteady shallow water ﬂows over irregular geometry is described. As test cases, laboratory experimental data are used together with academic tests for validation.},

	abstract = {The term entrapment zone has been used to describe a zone of elevated concentrations of particles, plankton, and juvenile fish observed in low-salinity areas of north (San Francisco) bay and the western Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California. The hypothesized mechanism for entrapment was a combination of particle aggregation, sinking and a residual current null zone. The null zone is a time-mean, near-bed flow convergence where riverine flow ends and gravitational circulation begins that was presumed to occur near a salinity of 2 psu. Current-meter measurements made prior to 1990 provide evidence of gravitational circulation and a null zone during autumn in the north bay of San Francisco Bay, including Suisun Bay and the western delta. Data collected after 1990, however, show an absence of gravitational circulation from most of Suisun Bay during spring, and the presence of multiple gravitational circulation cells between bathymetric constrictions elsewhere in the bay. Because null zones appear to be bathymetrically controlled, they often occur in areas far removed from the low salinity zone (near X 2 , the position of a bottom salinity of 2 psu). The presence or absence of gravitational circulation can be predicted with appropriate physical scaling, which explains the most recent and historical current-meter observations throughout the Bay/Delta system. In areas where gravitational circulation is weak or nonexistent, some other physical or biological mechanism(s)must be causing the observed concentration of particles and organisms in the low-salinity zone. Four physical mechanisms are discussed in this chapter: density-current pulses that occur near slack tide, ebb/flood shear stress asymmetries, vertical migration of organisms during the tidal cycle, and an upstream mass flux known as Stokes’ drift. Stokes’ drift was eliminated from further consideration because variations in sea level are small relative to the mean depth and because of the weak correlation between sea level and the tidal currents in Suisun Bay.},

In this paper, we investigate reasons for the failure of the G.L. Mellor, T. Yamada [Reviews of Geophysics 20 (1982) 851] level 2.5 closure model and suggest a remedy for this. We further discuss a new non-equilibrium closure model by V.M. Canuto, A. Howard, Y. Cheng, M.S. Dubovikov (Journal of Physical Oceanography, 2000, accepted for publication) which has proven to allow for stable calculations. All models are then numerically tested with a simple wind entrainment experiment motivated by the H. Kato, O.M. Phillips [Journal of Fluid Mechanics 37 (1969) 643] laboratory experiment, with the aid of which the instability of the Mellor and Yamada (1982) and the stability of the Canuto et al. (2000) model are con®rmed. The Canuto et al. (2000) model has three advantages compared to the Mellor and Yamada (1982) which are (i) the symmetry of stability functions, (ii) a higher critical Richardson number, and (iii) that the normalised shear stress increases with normalised shear for turbulence equilibrium. The latter advantage of the new model causes its high physical and numerical stability. Ó 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The aim of this one-dimensional water column study is to combine modiﬁed versions of three characteristic parameters for periodic tidal ﬂow under the inﬂuence of a longitudinal buoyancy gradient—the horizontal Richardson number, the inverse Strouhal number, and the inverse Ekman number—into a parameter space study, including constant wind forcing from various directions. It is shown how the underlying dynamical equations can be cast into nondimensional form, depending mainly on these three nondimensional parameters plus the relative wind speed and the wind direction. Idealized model simulations are carried out for the whole realistic range of horizontal Richardson and inverse Strouhal numbers for various latitudes, showing the amplitude of the tidally induced stratiﬁcation for a wide range of scenarios. It is found that classical threshold values for the horizontal Richardson number, indicating the switch from periodic stratiﬁcation to permanent stratiﬁcation, are valid only for special cases, and that this switch also strongly depends on the inverse Strouhal number, the inverse Ekman number, and the wind vector. The transverse residual ﬂow is close to the thermal wind balance for a variety of parameters, and nondimensionalized longitudinal residual ﬂow shows the classical estuarine exchange ﬂow pattern with little variation in the near-bed onshore component. Wind straining is conﬁrmed as an important estuarine and coastal process, enhancing estuarine circulation for offshore (down estuary) winds and vice versa. Agreement with ﬁeld data from Liverpool Bay is good, including the explanation of a ﬂood tide local maximum of the dissipation rate in the upper half of the water column. An equation for the second time derivative of the potential energy anomaly is derived for quantifying the dynamical processes leading to stratiﬁcation due to the straining of the horizontal density gradient.},

	abstract = {This numerical modeling study quantiﬁes for the ﬁrst time the contribution of various processes to estuarine circulation in periodically stratiﬁed tidal ﬂow under the impact of a constant horizontal buoyancy gradient. The one-dimensional water column equations with periodic forcing are ﬁrst cast into nondimensional form, resulting in a multidimensional parameter space spanned by the modiﬁed inverse Strouhal number and the modiﬁed horizontal Richardson number, as well as relative wind speed and wind direction and the residual runoff. The along-tide momentum equation is then solved for the tidal-mean velocity proﬁle in such a way that it is equated to the sum of the contributions of tidal straining (resulting from the temporal correlation between eddy viscosity and vertical shear), gravitational circulation (resulting from the depth-varying forcing by a constant horizontal buoyancy gradient), wind straining, and depth-mean residual ﬂow (resulting from net freshwater runoff). This deﬁnition of tidal straining does not only account for tidal asymmetries resulting from horizontal buoyancy gradients but also from wind straining and residual runoff. For constant eddy viscosity, the well-known estuarine circulation analytical solution with polynomial residual proﬁles is directly obtained. For vertically parabolic and constant-in-time eddy viscosity, a new analytic solution with logarithmic residual proﬁles is found, showing that the intensity of the gravitational circulation scales with the horizontal Richardson number. For scenarios with realistic spatially and temporally varying eddy viscosity, a numerical water column model equipped with a state-of-the-art two-equation turbulence closure model is applied to quantify the individual contributions of the various processes to estuarine circulation. The fundamental outcome of this study is that, for irrotational ﬂow with periodic stratiﬁcation and without wind forcing and residual runoff, the tidal straining is responsible for about two-thirds and gravitational circulation is responsible for about one-third of the estuarine circulation, proportionally dependent on the horizontal Richardson number, and weakly dependent on the Strouhal number. This new and robust result conﬁrms earlier estimates by H. Burchard and H. Baumert, who suggested that tidal straining is the major generation mechanism for estuarine turbidity maxima. However, a sensitivity analysis of the model results to details of the turbulence closure model shows some uncertainty with respect to the parameterization of sheared convection during ﬂood. Increasing down-estuary wind straining and residual runoff reduce the quantitative contribution of tidal straining. For relatively small horizontal Richardson numbers, the tidal straining contribution to estuarine circulation may even be reversed by down-estuary wind straining.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new model for active contours to detect objects in a given image, based on techniques of curve evolution, Mumford–Shah functional for segmentation and level sets. Our model can detect objects whose boundaries are not necessarily defined by gradient. We minimize an energy which can be seen as a particular case of the minimal partition problem. In the level set formulation, the problem becomes a “mean-curvature flow”-like evolving the active contour, which will stop on the desired boundary. However, the stopping term does not depend on the gradient of the image, as in the classical active contour models, but is instead related to a particular segmentation of the image. We will give a numerical algorithm using finite differences. Finally, we will present various experimental results and in particular some examples for which the classical snakes methods based on the gradient are not applicable. Also, the initial curve can be anywhere in the image, and interior contours are automatically detected.},

	abstract = {A 3D hydrodynamic model [Regional Ocean Model System ({ROMS})] is used to investigate how axial wind inﬂuences stratiﬁcation and to explore the associated longitudinal salt transport in partially mixed estuaries. The model is conﬁgured to represent a straight estuarine channel connecting to a shelf sea. The results conﬁrm that wind straining of the along-channel salinity gradient exerts an important control on stratiﬁcation. Two governing parameters are identiﬁed: the Wedderburn number (W) deﬁned as the ratio of wind stress to axial baroclinic pressure gradient force, and the ratio of an entrainment depth to water depth (hs/H). Here W controls the effectiveness of wind straining, which promotes increases (decreases) in stratiﬁcation during down-estuary (up-estuary) wind. The ratio hs/H determines the portion of the water column affected by direct wind mixing. While stratiﬁcation is always reduced by up-estuary wind, stratiﬁcation shows an increase-then-decrease transition when down-estuary wind stress increases. Such transition is a result of the competition between wind straining and direct wind mixing. A horizontal Richardson number modiﬁed to include wind straining/mixing is shown to reasonably represent the transition, and a regime diagram is proposed to classify the wind’s role on stratiﬁcation. Mechanisms driving salt ﬂux during axial wind events are also explored. At the onset and end of the wind events, barotropic adjustment drives strong transient salt ﬂuxes. Net salt ﬂux is controlled by the responses of subtidal shear dispersion to wind forcing. Moderate down-estuary winds enhance subtidal shear dispersion, whereas up-estuary winds always reduce it. Supporting observations from upper Chesapeake Bay are presented.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-dimensionalparticle tracking technique for applying the Lagrangian-Eulerian finite element method to solve transport equations in transient-state simulations. In the {LagrangianEulerian} approach, the advection term is handled in the Lagrangian step so that the associated numerical errors can be considerably reduced. It is important to have an adequate particle tracking technique for computing advection accurately in the Lagrangian step. The particle tracking technique presented here is designed to trace fictitious particles in the real-world flow field where the flow velocity is either measured or computed at a limited number of locations. The technique, named ‘in-element’ particle tracking, traces fictitious particles on an element-by-element basis. Given a velocity field, a fictitious particle is traced one element by one element until either a boundary is encounteredor the availabletime is completely consumed. For the tracking within an element, the element is divided into a desired number of subelementswith the interpolated velocity computed at all nodes of the subelements. A fictitious particle, thus, is traced one subelementby one subelement within the element. The desired number of subelementscan be determined based on the complexityof the flow field being considered.The more complicated the flow field is, the more subelementsare needed to achieveaccurate particletracking results. A single-velocity approach can be used to efficiently perform particle tracking in a smooth flow field, while an average-velocityapproach can be employed to increase the tracking accuracy for more complex flow fields.},

This accurately resolves tidal hydrodynamics in a domain that extends from the Paciﬁc Ocean to the western portion of the Delta region, the ﬂow through which is approximated with two rectangular boxes as a ‘‘false delta’’. A detailed calibration is performed, and we show that the model accurately predicts tidal heights, currents, and salinity at several locations throughout the Bay. We perform a sensitivity study to understand the effects of grid resolution, the turbulence model, and the scalar transport scheme. Three levels of grid reﬁnement are performed, and the results of a second-order accurate, {TVD} scalar transport scheme are compared to those with ﬁrst-order upwinding. We ﬁnd that the best convergence rate with respect to grid reﬁnement occurs when the {TVD} scheme is employed. This accuracy degrades when the turbulence model is not employed due to a lack of feedback between vertical turbulent mixing and stratiﬁcation. Signiﬁcant horizontal diffusion associated with ﬁrst-order upwinding eliminates the necessary horizontal salinity gradients required to induce baroclinic circulation, and renders the results less sensitive to the turbulence model or grid reﬁnement.},

	abstract = {Coastal tides are influenced by several factors and one of the most important of these is the character of the adjacent continental shelf. A continental margin theory is derived and used to discuss several different aspects of the effect "'smooth" continental shelves have on tides. The main results are as follows. (a) The theory suggests, in accordance with observations, that semi-diurnal tides should be amplified on wide shelves in mid and low latitudes, but that diurnal tides should not be amplified. (b) Continental shelf tidal resonance occurs when the shelf scale 9{\textasciitilde}/(co2\_ f 2 ) ({\textasciitilde} = shelf b o t t o m slope, co = tidal frequency) is approximately equal to the shelf width. Theoretical arguments and observation can be used to show that shelf resonance occurs, for example, along sections of the northwest Australian shelf. (c) Given the easily obtained coastal tide, theory shows that tides over the continental shelf and slope can be approximately estimated analytically. Calculations using simple prediction formulae can be made on a hand calculator. Subject to some restrictions, a simple and inexpensive method is thus available for estimating barotropic tides on continental shelves. (d) An appropriate boundary condition for global numerical tidal models, which cannot resolve the continental margin region, is derived. For the diurnal tides, the boundary condition can be well approximated by an impermeable wall condition at the deep-sea continental slope boundary. For the semi-diurnal tides, the impermeable wall condition usually, but not always, suffices ; it can break down on wide continental shelves.},

Based on experimental laboratory studies, we have developed a new calibration method for free-ﬂowing and submerged radial gates that allows for multiple gates and widely varying upstream and downstream channel conditions. The method uses the energy equation on the upstream side of the structure and the momentum equation on the downstream side, and thus is called the {EnergyMomentum} Method. An iterative solution is required to solve these two equations, but this allows calibration from free ﬂow to submerged ﬂow continuously through the transition. Adjustments to the energy equation for free ﬂow are described, along with an additional energy adjustment for the transition to submerged ﬂow. An application is used to describe the new procedure and how it overcomes the limitations of current energy-based methods.},

The model uses linear functions for horizontal velocity and tracers on tetrahedra, and for surface elevation on surface triangles. The vertical velocity ﬁeld is elementwise constant. An important ingredient of the model is the Galerkin least-squares stabilization used to minimize eﬀects of unresolved boundary layers and make the matrices to be inverted in time-stepping better conditioned. The model performance was tested in a 16-year simulation of the North Atlantic using a mesh covering the area between 7° and 80° N and providing variable horizontal resolution from 0.3° to 1.5°.},

	abstract = {Unstructured meshes are common in coastal modeling, but still rarely used for modeling the large-scale ocean circulation. Existing and new projects aim at changing this situation by proposing models enabling a regional focus (multiresolution) in global setups, without nesting and open boundaries. Among them, ﬁnite-volume models using the C-grid discretization on Voronoi-centroidal meshes or cell-vertex quasi-B-grid discretization on triangular meshes work well and offer the multiresolution functionality at a price of being 2 to 4 times slower per degree of freedom than structured-mesh models. This is already sufﬁcient for many practical tasks and will be further improved as the number of vertical layers is increased. Approaches based on the ﬁnite-element method, both used or proposed, are as a rule slower at present. Most of staggered discretizations on triangular or Voronoi meshes allow spurious modes which are difﬁcult to ﬁlter on unstructured meshes. The ongoing research seeks how to handle them and explores new approaches where such modes are absent. Issues of numerical efﬁciency and accurate transport schemes are still important, and the question on parameterizations for multiresolution meshes is hardly explored at all. The review summarizes recent developments the main practical result of which is the emergence of multiresolution models for simulating large-scale ocean circulation.},

A generic system of diffusion equations is considered, in which the diffusivities depend on the solutions and their gradients. The stability of the solutions is investigated, showing that small-scale space perturbations can be unstable. The associated stability criterion is established, indicating that instabilities, if any, are due to the diffusivities depending in an inappropriate way on the gradient of the solutions. Numerical simulations of Kato-Phillips flows are performed, which may be regarded as a highly idealised representation of the upper layers of the ocean. Several versions of the Munk-Anderson and Mellor-Yamada turbulence closure schemes are implemented. The stable or unstable nature of their behaviour is seen to be in good agreement with the predictions of the theoretical stability analysis.},

	abstract = {We present a systematic analysis of generation mechanisms for exchange ﬂows in partially stratiﬁed estuaries using water column (1DV) and width-averaged (2DV) numerical models. We focus on exchange ﬂows generated by eddy viscosity-shear covariance ({ESCO}). We identify two distinctly different physical mechanisms. The ﬁrst, tidal {ESCO} circulation, results from interactions between the barotropic tide and temporal variations of the eddy viscosity. While this ﬂow is mostly generated by direct interactions between the tide and eddy viscosity variations at the main tidal frequency, a similarly important contribution can be attributed to indirect interactions. These are more complex interactions involving eddy viscosity variations at other frequencies than the main tidal frequency (e.g., M4). The second mechanism is called gravitational {ESCO} circulation. This results from an ampliﬁcation of the gravitational circulation through indirect interactions between the gravitational circulation and temporal variations of the eddy viscosity at any time scale. Tidal and gravitational {ESCO} circulations are generated by different mechanisms and have a different dependency on the phase and frequency of eddy viscosity variations and the density gradient. The relative contributions of gravitational circulation and tidal and gravitational {ESCO} circulation to the exchange ﬂow are typically 1/3 each in tidally energetic well-mixed or partially stratiﬁed estuaries. The results are generalized using an idealized width-averaged model of the Scheldt River estuary. This model conﬁrms the results of the water column model and additionally shows that temporal variations of turbulence not captured in the water column model have a signiﬁcant effect on the exchange ﬂow.},

Particular emphasis is given on the simulation of pollution sources (e.g. outfalls) whose spatial extend is small compared to that of the domain discretization. A hybrid particle tracking / Eulerian-Lagrangian method is developed and analyzed for the simulation of small scale sources: Mass discharge from the source is modeled by the release of particles. When the standard deviation of the particle distribution reaches a length scale of the order of the grid scale particle locations are mapped onto node concentrations and the calculations proceed in the Eulerian-Lagrangian mode. A technique for the interfacing of the particle tracking mode and the Eulerian-Lagrangian mode is developed. The developed method for the simulation of sources is applied for the simulation of outfalls in coastal water problems. The issue of consistently modeling the intermediate flow field around the diffuseris investigated. In order to demonstrate the performance of the developed model it is applied in Massachusetts Bay.},

Using only {ADCP} data, vectors that define the velocity field of a channel can be displayed in perspective over detailed bathymetry. In addition, the backscatter intensity recorded with {ADCP} velocity data provides a sediment-transport indicator. The prevalence of {ADCPs} and their ability to measure velocity fields encourages the exploitation of backscatter-intensity values for sediment-transport studies. At present, spatial {ADCP} data from channel surveys have been interpolated to volumetric vector grids to show flow and sediment dynamics through time animation. These visualizations have highlighted some discrepancies between expected flow properties and analyses of {ADCP} data, and field experiments are suggested to identify their origin.

Velocity vectors along each survey path were interpolated to a three-dimensional Cartesian grid that conformed to local bathymetry. A separate array of vectors was interpolated onto a grid from each survey. By displaying interpolated vector grids sequentially with computer animation, ﬂow dynamics of the reach could be studied in three-dimensions as ﬂow responded to the tidal cycle.

	abstract = {Recent observations over the Sigsbee Escarpment in the Gulf of Mexico have revealed extremely energetic deep currents (near 1 m {sÀ}1), which are trapped along the escarpment. Both scientiﬁc interest and engineering needs demand dynamical understanding of these extreme events, and can beneﬁt from a numerical model designed to complement observational and theoretical investigations in this region of complicated topography. The primary objective of this study is to develop a modeling methodology capable of simulating these physical processes and apply the model to the Sigsbee Escarpment region. The very steep slope of the Sigsbee Escarpment (0.05–0.1) limits the application of ocean models with traditional terrain-following (sigma) vertical coordinates, which may represent the very complicated topography in the region adequately, can result in large truncation errors during calculation of the horizontal pressure gradient. A new vertical coordinate system, termed a vanishing quasi-sigma coordinate, is implemented in the Navy Coastal Ocean Model for application to the Sigsbee Escarpment region. Vertical coordinate surfaces for this grid have noticeably gentler slopes than a traditional sigma grid, while still following the terrain near the ocean bottom. The new vertical grid is tested with a suite of numerical experiments and compared to a classical sigma-layer model. The numerical error is substantially reduced in the model with the new vertical grid. A one-year, realistic, numerical simulation is performed to simulate strong, deep currents over the Escarpment using a very-high-resolution nested modeling approach. The model results are analyzed to demonstrate that the deep-ocean currents in the simulation replicate the prominent dynamical features of the observed intense currents in the region.},

The method handles the case when the eddy diffusivity varies linearly to zero at a boundary. This is done by using the first few terms of the series representation of the analytic solution for this case to construct the non-Gaussian position distribution. Comparison of numerical simulation results to analytic solutions of the diffusion equation show that this method is accurate and significantly more efficient than a previously used methods that assume a Gaussian particle position distribution.},

This algorithm is well suited for large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of spin models using cluster dynamics on parallel computers with large numbers of processors.

By controlling overhead and reducing inter-processor communication this method attains good computational speed-up and eﬃciency. Large systems of up to 655362 spins have been simulated at updating speeds of 11 nanosecs/site (90.7 × 106 spin updates/sec) using state-of-the-art supercomputers. In the second part of the article we use the cluster algorithm to study the relaxation of magnetization and energy on large Ising models using Swendsen-Wang dynamics. We found evidence that exponential and power law factors are present in the relaxation process as has been proposed by Hackl et al. The variation of the power-law exponent λM taken at face value indicates that the value of {zM} falls in the interval 0.31 − 0.49 for the time interval analysed and appears to vanish asymptotically.},

Direct measurements of the Reynolds stress show a signiﬁcant asymmetry over the tidal cycle where stresses are enhanced during the ﬂood tide and less prominent over the ebb tide. This asymmetry is corroborated by logarithmic ﬁts using 10 min averaged velocity data. A smaller yet similar tendency asymmetry in drag coefﬁcient is inferred by ﬁtting the velocity and estimated large-scale pressure gradient to a one-dimensional along-channel momentum balance. This smaller asymmetry is consistent with recent modeling work simulating regional ﬂows in the vicinity of the study site. The asymmetry in drag suggests the importance of previously reported bed forms for this channel and demonstrates spatial and temporarily variations in bed stress. Secondary circulation patterns observed in a relatively straight section of channel appear driven by local curvature rather than being remotely forced by the regions of signiﬁcant curvature only a few hundred meters from the measurement site.},

This new form is found to describe a wide variety of measurements recorded in the open ocean, coast, fetch-limited seas, and lakes, with almost one and the same set of parameters. This is the result of a reanalysis of the deﬁnition of the drag coefﬁcient in the marine boundary layer, which ﬁnds that a constant is missing from the traditional deﬁnition of the drag coefﬁcient. The constant arises because the neutral friction velocity over water surfaces is not directly proportional to the 10-m wind speed, a consequence of the transition to rough ﬂow at low wind speeds. Within the rough ﬂow regime, the neutral friction velocity is linearly dependent on the 10-m wind speed; consequently, within this rough regime, the new deﬁnition of the drag coefﬁcient is not a function of the wind speed. The magnitude of the new deﬁnition of the neutral drag coefﬁcient represents an upper limit to the magnitude of the traditional deﬁnition.},

	abstract = {A ﬁnite-volume formulation is presented that solves the three-dimensional, nonhydrostatic Navier–Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation on an unstructured, staggered, z-level grid, with the goal of simulating nonhydrostatic processes in the coastal ocean with grid resolutions of tens of meters. In particular, the code has been developed to simulate the nonlinear, nonhydrostatic internal wave ﬁeld in the littoral ocean. The method is based on the formulation developed by Casulli, in that the free-surface and vertical diﬀusion are semi-implicit, thereby removing stability limitations associated with the surface gravity wave and vertical diﬀusion terms. The remaining terms in the momentum equations are discretized explicitly with the second-order Adams–Bashforth method, while the pressure-correction method is employed for the nonhydrostatic pressure in order to achieve overall second-order temporal accuracy. Advection of momentum is accomplished with an Eulerian discretization which conserves momentum in cells that do not contain the free surface, and scalar advection is discretized in a way that ensures consistency with continuity, thereby ensuring local and global mass conservation using a velocity ﬁeld that conserves volume on a local and global basis. The nonhydrostatic pressure ﬁeld is solved eﬃciently using a block-Jacobi preconditioner, and while stability is limited by the internal gravity wave speed and vertical advection of momentum, applications requiring relatively small time steps due to accuracy or stability constraints are run eﬃciently on parallel computers, since the present formulation is written entirely with the message-passing interface ({MPI}). The {ParMETIS} libraries are employed in order to achieve a load-balanced parallel partitioning that minimizes interprocessor communication, and the grid is reordered to optimize per-processor performance by limiting cache misses while accessing arrays in memory. Test cases demonstrate the ability of the code to eﬃciently and accurately compute the nonhydrostatic lock exchange and internal waves in idealized as well as real domains, and we evaluate the parallel eﬃciency of the code using up to 32 processors.},

	abstract = {A simple numerical model demonstrates that the reduction in turbulence due to stratification greatly enhances the trapping of suspended sediment that occurs at the estuarine turbidity maximum. In moderately and highly stratified estuaries the turbulent diffusivity decreases markedly between the region upstream of the salinity intrusion, where the turbulence is uninhibited by salt stratification, and the stratified regime within the salinity intrusion, where turbulence is reduced by the inhibitory influence of salt stratification. This reduction in turbulent diffusion results in a reduction in the quantity of sediment that can be carried by the flow, causing sediment to be trapped near the landward limit of the salinity intrusion. This trapping process occurs at the same location as that due to the estuarine convergence, but it appears to be many times more effective at trapping silt-size particles. A model is formulated that is similar to Festa and Hansen’s (1978) model of the estuarine turbidity maximum, with the addition of a stratification-dependent eddy diffusivity. For silt-size sediment particles, the model indicates as much as a to-fold increase in the trapping rate with inclusion of the stratification effect. It is likely that this mechanism is important in many partially mixed and highly stratified estuaries.},

	abstract = {Estuarine turbulence is notable in that both the dissipation rate and the buoyancy frequency extend to much higher values than in other natural environments. The high dissipation rates lead to a distinct inertial subrange in the velocity and scalar spectra, which can be exploited for quantifying the turbulence quantities. However, high buoyancy frequencies lead to small Ozmidov scales, which require high sampling rates and small spatial aperture to resolve the turbulent ﬂuxes. A set of observations in a highly stratiﬁed estuary demonstrate the effectiveness of a vessel-mounted turbulence array for resolving turbulent processes, and for relating the turbulence to the forcing by the Reynolds-averaged ﬂow. The observations focus on the ebb, when most of the buoyancy ﬂux occurs. Three stages of mixing are observed: (1) intermittent and localized but intense shear instability during the early ebb; (2) continuous and relatively homogeneous shear-induced mixing during the mid-ebb, and weakly stratiﬁed, boundary-layer mixing during the late ebb. The mixing efﬁciency as quantiﬁed by the ﬂux Richardson number R f was frequently observed to be higher than the canonical value of 0.15 from Osborn (J Phys Oceanogr 10:83–89, 1980). The high efﬁciency may be linked to the temporal–spatial evolution of shear instabilities.},

	abstract = {Recent research in estuaries challenges the long-standing paradigm of the gravitationally driven estuarine circulation. In estuaries with relatively strong tidal forcing and modest buoyancy forcing, the tidal variation in stratiﬁcation leads to a tidal straining circulation driven by tidal variation in vertical mixing, with a magnitude that may signiﬁcantly exceed the gravitational circulation. For weakly stratiﬁed estuaries, vertical and lateral advection are also important contributors to the tidally driven residual circulation. The apparent contradiction with the conventional paradigm is resolved when the estuarine parameter space is mapped with respect to a mixing parameter M that is based on the ratio of the tidal timescale to the vertical mixing timescale. Estuaries with high M values exhibit strong tidal nonlinearity, and those with small M values show conventional estuarine dynamics. Estuaries with intermediate mixing rates show marked transitions between these regimes at timescales of the spring-neap cycle.},

We discuss both linear and non linear problems. In the ﬁrst group, we consider the wave equation, the Maxwell system and the linear elasticity problem. In the second group, we ﬁrstly study conservative systems as the magneto-hydrodynamic system, the Euler equations together with its classical reduced versions : isentropic, isothermal and shallow-water approximations and ﬁnally we consider complex (non conservative) models arising in the numerical computation of two ﬂuid models.

All model parameters in the salinity simulation are identical to those used in a model calibration in which the model is shown to reproduce current meter data accurately. The 64-day time period studied is characterized by low freshwater input. During this period, the observed salinity data is reproduced well by the model. Because no model parameters are adjusted, the salinity simulation is considered to be a veriﬁcation of the model. Once the model is veriﬁed, it is used to explore the importance of stratiﬁcation and baroclinic pressure gradients on long-term transport. It is concluded that, under conditions of moderate density gradients, the density-driven ﬂow and mild periodic stratiﬁcation that results have a signiﬁcant effect on scalar transport.},

	abstract = {A general theory to describe and understand advective and diffusive ocean transport is reported. It allows any passive tracer ﬁeld with an atmospheric source to be constructed by superposing sea surface contributions with a generalized Green’s function called the boundary propagator of the passive tracer equation. The boundary propagator has the interpretation of the joint water-mass and transit-time distribution from the sea surface. The theory thus includes the classical oceanographic idea of water-mass analysis and extends it to allow for a distribution of transit times from the sea surface. The joint water-mass and transit-time distribution contains complete information about the transport processes in the ﬂow. It captures this information in a more accessible way than using velocity and diffusivity ﬁelds, however, at least for the case of sequestration and transport of dissolved material by the ocean circulation. The boundary propagator is thus the natural quantity to consider when discussing both steady-state and transient ocean tracers, including the inverse problem of interpreting tracer data in terms of ocean circulation. Two constraints on the shape of the transit-time distributions are derived. First, the asymptotic behavior for a steady, or time-averaged, circulation is exponential decay. Second, integrated over the whole ocean, the transit-time distribution from the sea surface cannot increase. The theory is illustrated using a one-dimensional advection–diffusion model, a box model, and a North Atlantic general circulation model.},

In the pages that follow, we review both the practical as well as the theoretical aspects of {MDL} as a tool for model selection, emphasizing the rich connections between information theory and statistics. At the boundary between these two disciplines, we nd many interesting interpretations of popular frequentist and Bayesian procedures.

The salinity distribution, although coupled to the velocity distribution, is found to vary independently of it as well. The theoretical results are discussed in regard to: (i) correlation between the vertical variations of mean velocity and salinity, (ii) the role of this correlation in maintaining the steady-state salinity distribution in estuaries, and (iii) some implications for computations of ftushing and dispersion of contaminants.},

The optimality conditions for this {DTOC} problem lead to a linear system with block structure. This motivates the application of block Gauss–Seidel methods for its solution. We show that certain instantaneous control techniques can be viewed as the application of one step of the forward block Gauss–Seidel method applied to the {DTOC} optimality system.

on their role in entrainment and mixing. For highly entraining internal jumps, a 
new closure is proposed for the jump conditions. The closure is based on two main 
assumptions: (i) most of the energy dissipated at the jump goes into turbulence, 
and (ii) the amount of turbulent energy that a stably stratified flow may contain 
without immediately mixing further is bounded by a measure of the stratification. As 
a consequence of this closure, surprising bounds emerge, for example on the amount 
of entrainment that may take place at the location of the jump. These bounds are 
probably almost achieved by highly entraining internal jumps, such as those likely to 
develop in dense oceanic over flows. The values obtained here are in good agreement 
with the existing observations of the spatial development of oceanic downslope 
currents, which play a crucial role in the formation of abyssal and intermediate 
waters in the global ocean.},

	abstract = {The beneﬁts of unstructured grids in hydrodynamic models are well understood but in many cases lead to greater numerical diffusion compared with methods available on structured grids. The ﬂexible nature of unstructured grids, however, allows for the orientation of the grid to align locally with the dominant ﬂow direction and thus decrease numerical diffusion. We investigate the relationship between grid alignment and diffusive errors in the context of scalar transport in a triangular, unstructured, 3-D hydrodynamic code. Analytical results are presented for the 2-D anisotropic numerical diffusion tensor and veriﬁed against idealized simulations. Results from two physically realistic estuarine simulations, differing only in grid alignment, show signiﬁcant changes in gradients of salinity. Changes in scalar gradients are reﬂective of reduced numerical diffusion interacting with the complex 3-D structure of the transporting ﬂow. We also describe a method for utilizing ﬂow ﬁelds from an unaligned grid to generate a ﬂow-aligned grid with minimal supervision. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The distributions of particulate elements (Al, P, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb), dissolved trace metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, and Cd), and dissolved nutrients (nitrate, phosphate, and silicic acid) were investigated in the Gulf of the Farallones, a region of high productivity that is driven by the dynamic mixing of the San Francisco Bay plume, upwelled waters, and California coastal surface waters. Particulate metals were separated into {\textgreater}10 and 0.4–10 lm size-fractions and further fractionated into leachable (operationally deﬁned with a 25\% acetic acid leach) and refractory particulate concentrations. Dissolved metals ({\textless} 0.4 lm pore-size ﬁltrate) were separated into colloidal (0.03–0.4 lm) and soluble ({\textless}0.03 lm) fractions. The percent leachable particulate fractions ranged from 2\% to 99\% of the total particulate concentration for these metals with Mn and Cd being predominantly leachable and Fe and Al being predominantly refractory. The leachable particulate Pb concentration was associated primarily with suspended sediments from San Francisco Bay and was a tracer of the plume in coastal waters. The particulate trace metal data suggest that the leachable fraction was an available source of trace metal micronutrients to the primary productivity in coastal waters. The dissolved trace metals in the San Francisco Bay plume and freshly upwelled surface waters were similar in concentration, with the exception of Cu and Co, which exhibited relatively high concentrations in plume waters and served as tracers of this water mass. The dissolved data and estimates of the plume dynamics suggest that the impact of anthropogenic inputs of nutrients and trace metals in the San Francisco Bay plume contributes substantially to the concentrations found in the Gulf of the Farallones (10–50\% of estimated upwelled ﬂux values), but does not greatly disrupt the natural stoichiometric balance of trace metal and nutrient elements within coastal waters given the similarity in concentrations to sources in upwelled water. In all, the data from this study demonstrate that the ﬂux of dissolved nutrients and bioactive trace metals from the San Francisco Bay plume contribute to the high and relatively constant phytoplankton biomass observed in the Gulf of the Farallones.},

The first is to use tidal-monthly variations in the density and velocity fields and the salt and water transports as keys to understanding the circulation of the Columbia River Estuary and other shallow river estuaries. The Columbia River Estuary is a good natural laboratory in this regard, because the flushing time of the system (a few days) is short relative to the tidal month during all seasons. This allows the occurrence of distinct transitions from a strongly to a weakly stratified water column (and back) during the tidal month. Furthermore, because atmospheric processes are secondary to riverflow and tidal influence in determining the circulation, most of the energy in circulatory phenomena is confined to distinct tidal, tidal-monthly and seasonal frequency bands. Observations of salt transport and neap-spring transitions reported herein should provide important constraints on future theoretical studies of estuaxine circulation.},

	abstract = {The vertical distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate was measured using an array of four acoustic Doppler velocimeters in the shallow embayment of Grizzly Bay, San Francisco Bay, California. Owing to the combination of wind and tide forcing in this shallow system, the surface and bottom boundary layers overlapped. Whitecapping waves were generated for a significant spectral peak steepness greater than 0.05 or above a wind speed of 3 m {sϪ}1. Under conditions of whitecapping waves, the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate in the upper portion of the water column was greatly enhanced, relative to the predictions of wind stress wall-layer theory. Instead, the dissipation followed a modified deep-water breaking-wave scaling. Near the bed (bottom 10\% of the water column), the dissipation measurements were either equal to or less than that predicted by wall-layer theory. Stratification due to concentration gradients in suspended sediment was identified as the likely cause for these periods of production–dissipation imbalance close to the bed. During 50\% of the well-mixed conditions experienced in the month-long experiment, whitecapping waves provided the dominant source of turbulent kinetic energy over 90\% or more of the water column.},

These inverse models assume that the system’s variability is driven by spatially coherent, additive noise that is white in time and are constructed in the phase space of the dataset’s leading empirical orthogonal functions. Multiple linear regression has been widely used to obtain inverse stochastic models; it is generalized here in two ways. First, the dynamics is allowed to be nonlinear by using polynomial regression. Second, a multilevel extension of classic regression allows the additive noise to be correlated in time; to do so, the residual stochastic forcing at a given level is modeled as a function of variables at this level and the preceding ones. The number of variables, as well as the order of nonlinearity, is determined by optimizing model performance.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a high-resolution numerical method for solving mass transport problems involving advection and anisotropic diffusion in shallow water based on unstructured mesh. An alternating operator-splitting technique is adopted to advance the numerical solution with advection and diffusion terms solved separately in two steps. By introducing a new r-factor into the Total Variation Diminishing ({TVD}) limiter, an improved ﬁnite-volume method is developed to solve the advection term with signiﬁcant reduction of numerical diffusion and oscillation errors. In addition, a coordinate transformation is introduced to simplify the diffusion term with the Green-Gauss theorem used to deal with the anisotropic effect based on unstructured mesh. The new scheme is validated against three benchmark cases with separated and combined advection and diffusion transport processes involved. Results show that the scheme performs better than existing methods in predicting the advective transport, particularly when a sharp concentration front is in presence. The model also provides a sound solution for the anisotropic diffusion phenomenon. Anisotropic diffusion has been largely neglected by existing ﬂow models based on unstructured mesh, which usually treat the diffusion process as being isotropic for simplicity. Based on the ﬂow ﬁeld provided by the {ELCIRC} model, the developed transport model was successfully applied to simulate the transport of a hypothetical conservative tracer in a bay under the inﬂuence of tides.},

Several algorithms for spatial disaggregation and for disaggregation of annual to monthly ﬂows are available. However, the disaggregation of monthly to daily or weekly to daily ﬂows remains a challenge. A new algorithm is presented for simultaneously disaggregating monthly ﬂows at a number of sites and daily ﬂows at an index site to daily ﬂows at a number of sites on a drainage network. The continuity of ﬂow in time across months at each site as well as the intersite ﬂow pattern are preserved. The disaggregated daily ﬂows at the multiple sites are conditioned on the spatial (across site) pattern of monthly ﬂows at the respective sites. The probability distribution of the vector of disaggregated ﬂows conditional on the multisite monthly ﬂows is approximated nonparametrically using the k nearest neighbors of the monthly spatial ﬂow pattern. A constrained optimization problem is solved to adaptively estimate the disaggregated ﬂows in space and time for each such neighborhood. An application to data from a tributary of the Colorado River is used to illustrate the modeling process.},

Secondary currents were strong at times (varying by up to 35 cm/s from top to bottom) but relatively transient, as the balance between centrifugal and lateral baroclinic forcing changed over time. The short travel time around the bend did not allow a steady state balance to develop between centrifugal and lateral baroclinic forcing. During the flood tide the confluence of two streams with different velocities produced a strong lateral gradient in streamwise velocity. As a result, lateral advection was a significant term in the streamwise momentum balance, having the same order of magnitude as the barotropic and baroclinic pressure gradients, and the frictional terms. During the first part of the ebb, secondary currents were induced by lateral baroclinic forcing. The direction of the secondary circulation reversed later in the ebb, as the baroclinic forcing became weaker than the centrifugal acceleration. The gradient Richardson number showed that stratification was stable over most of the tidal cycle, decreasing the importance of friction and allowing secondary currents to persist.},

Results of the theoretical development and analysis of the equations are substantiated in a set of numerical experiments conducted using alternate equation forms.

	abstract = {The dynamics of lateral circulation in an idealized, straight estuary under varying stratiﬁcation conditions is investigated using a three-dimensional, hydrostatic, primitive equation model in order to determine the importance of lateral circulation to the momentum budget within the estuary. For all model runs, lateral circulation is about 4 times as strong during ﬂood tides as during ebbs. This ﬂood–ebb asymmetry is due to a feedback between the lateral circulation and the along-channel tidal currents, as well as to time-varying stratiﬁcation over a tidal cycle. As the stratiﬁcation is increased, the lateral circulation is signiﬁcantly reduced because of the adverse pressure gradient set up by isopycnals being tilted by the lateral ﬂow itself. When rotation is included, a timedependent, cross-channel Ekman circulation is driven, and the tidally averaged, bottom lateral circulation is enhanced toward the right bank (when looking toward the ocean in the Northern Hemisphere). This asymmetry in the tidally averaged bottom lateral circulation may lead to asymmetric sediment transport, leading to asymmetric channel proﬁles in straight estuaries. For the weakly stratiﬁed model run, advection due to lateral currents is a dominant term in both the along-channel and cross-channel momentum equations over a tidal cycle and for the tidally averaged momentum equations. In the tidally averaged, along-channel momentum equation, lateral advection acts as a driving term for the estuarine exchange ﬂow and can be larger than the along-channel pressure gradient. Therefore, it should not be ignored when estimating momentum budgets in estuaries.},

            The subtidal salt balance and the mechanisms driving the downgradient salt flux in the Hudson River estuary are investigated using measurements from a cross-channel mooring array of current meters, temperature and conductivity sensors, and cross-channel and along-estuary shipboard surveys obtained during the spring of 2002. Steady (subtidal) vertical shear dispersion, resulting from the estuarine exchange flow, was the dominant mechanism driving the downgradient salt flux, and varied by over an order of magnitude over the spring–neap cycle, with maximum values during neap tides and minimum values during spring tides. Corresponding longitudinal dispersion rates were as big as 2500 m2 s−1 during neap tides. The salinity intrusion was not in a steady balance during the study period. During spring tides, the oceanward advective salt flux resulting from the net outflow balanced the time rate of change of salt content landward of the study site, and salt was flushed out of the estuary. During neap tides, the landward steady shear dispersion salt flux exceeded the oceanward advective salt flux, and salt entered the estuary. Factor-of-4 variations in the salt content occurred at the spring–neap time scale and at the time scale of variations in the net outflow. On average, the salt flux resulting from tidal correlations between currents and salinity (tidal oscillatory salt flux) was an order of magnitude smaller than that resulting from steady shear dispersion. During neap tides, this flux was minimal (or slightly countergradient) and was due to correlations between tidal currents and vertical excursions of the halocline. During spring tides, the tidal oscillatory salt flux was driven primarily by oscillatory shear dispersion, with an associated longitudinal dispersion rate of about 130 m2 s−1.},

	title = {Tidally driven residual circulation 1n shallow estuaries with lateral depth variation},
	abstract = {Tidally driven residual circulation in shallow estuaries with lateral depth variation has been studied analytically using a two-dimensional, depth-averaged model. The solution is presented for a v-shaped channel. Exchange flow is found to be correlated with the topography. The magnitude of this exchange flow depends mainly on four parameters: the ratio between the minimum depth on the shoal and the maximum depth in the channel, the ratio between the tidal amplitude at the mouth and the mean depth, the ratio between the length of the estuary and the tidal wave length, and the ratio between the tidal timescale and the decay timescale due to friction. Generally, a net landward flow occurs over the shoals and is balanced by a return flow in the channel. The along-channel residual velocity changes nearly linearly across the estuary. The residual velocity decreases monotonically toward the head of the estuary. The transverse residual velocity is convergent in the channel and divergent on the shoals. The residual velocity is highly dependent on the length of the estuary. When. the length of the estuary is much smaller than a quarter of the wave length, the residual velocity is relatively small. When the length of the estuary is about a quarter of the wave length, the magnitude of the residual velocity reaches its maximum. When the length of the estuary is much larger than a quarter of the wave length, the residual circulation approaches the pattern found in an infinite length estuary. On the basis of the analysis of the solution, we conclude that exchange flow generated by tides in a shallow estuary is the result of competition among several processes. An inward flux is caused by local nonlinearity, both in the bottom friction and from propagation of the tidal wave of finite amplitude. This inward flux is larger on the shoals and smaller in the channel owing to larger nonlinearity in the shallow water. The residual inward flow creates a setup (residual surface elevation) of water at the head of the estuary that produces a pressure gradient. This residual .pressure gradient is approximately uniform across the estuary and drives an outward flow that is larger in the channel than on the shoals. In all of the parameter space the competition results in a net inflow on the shoals and a net outflow in the channel.},

The assumption of horizontal homogeneity of the ﬁrst moments is fundamental to the derivation of the mean velocity vector because the velocity is never homogeneous over the span of the beams in a turbulent ﬂow. Two tests of this assumption are developed—a comparison of the mean error velocity against its standard deviation and against the mean speed. The fraction of the samples that pass these tests increases with increasing spatial averaging and exceeds 95\% for distances longer than 55 beam separations. The statistical uncertainty of the velocity and shear vector, averaged over 10 min and longer, stems from turbulent ﬂuctuations rather than Doppler noise. Estimation of the vertical velocity requires a correction for the bias in the measured tilt.},

Rapid samples of velocity data are used to estimate various parameters of turbulence with the covariance technique. The questions of bias and error sources, statistical uncertainty, and spectra are addressed. Estimates of the Reynolds stress are biased by the misalignment of the instrument axis with respect to vertical. This bias can be eliminated by a ﬁfth transducer directed along the instrument axis. The estimates of turbulent kinetic energy ({TKE}) density have a systematic bias of 5 ϫ 10Ϫ4 m2 {sϪ}2 due to Doppler noise, and the relative statistical uncertainty of the 20-min averages is usually less than 20\%–95\% conﬁdence. The bias in the Reynolds stress due to Doppler noise is less than Ϯ4 ϫ 10Ϫ5 m2. The band of zero signiﬁcance is never less than 1.5 ϫ 10Ϫ5 m2 {sϪ}2 due to Doppler noise, and this band increases with increasing {TKE} density. Velocity ﬂuctuations with periods longer than 20 min contribute little to either the stress or the {TKE} density. The rate of production of {TKE} density and the vertical eddy viscosity are derived and in agreement with expectations for a tidal channel.},

	abstract = {Although surface water quality and its underlying processes vary over time scales ranging from seconds to decades, they have historically been studied at the lower (weekly to interannual) frequencies. The aim of this study was to investigate intradaily variability of three water quality parameters in a small freshwater tidal lagoon (Mildred Island, California). High frequency time series of specific conductivity, water temperature, and chlorophyll a at two locations within the habitat were analyzed in conjunction with supporting hydrodynamic, meteorological, biological, and spatial mapping data. All three constituents exhibited large amplitude intradaily (e.g., semidiurnal tidal and diurnal) oscillations, and periodicity varied across constituents, space, and time. Like other tidal embayments, this habitat is influenced by several processes with distinct periodicities including physical controls, such as tides, solar radiation, and wind, and biological controls, such as photosynthesis, growth, and grazing. A scaling approach was developed to estimate individual process contributions to the observed variability. Scaling results were generally consistent with observations and together with detailed examination of time series and time derivatives, revealed specific mechanisms underlying the observed periodicities, including interactions between the tidal variability, heating, wind, and biology. The implications for monitoring were illustrated through subsampling of the data set. This exercise demonstrated how quantities needed by scientists and managers (e.g., mean or extreme concentrations) may be misrepresented by low frequency data and how short-duration high frequency measurements can aid in the design and interpretation of temporally coarser sampling programs. The dispersive export of chlorophyll a from the habitat exhibited a fortnightly variability corresponding to the modulation of semidiurnal tidal currents with the diurnal cycle of phytoplankton variability, demonstrating how high frequency interactions can govern long-term trends. Process identification, as through the scaling analysis here, can help us anticipate changes in system behavior and adapt our own interactions with the system.},

This study uses the concentration moment method to solve analytically for the dispersion coefficient of a solute in a tidal channel which exchanges advectively with volumes along its edges. This constitutes a new framework for analyzing the longitudinal dispersion that results from tidal trapping in systems such as a branching tidal channel or the breached salt ponds of San Francisco Bay. A comparison of dispersion coefficients from traditional, diffusion-driven frameworks for tidal trapping, the new advective framework derived in the present study, and observations show that the new formulation is best suited to this environment.},

These are also known as semi-Lagrangian methods in the atmospheric sciences. Such methods involve backward time integration of a characteristic equation to ®nd the departure point of a ¯uid particle arriving at a Eulerian grid point. The value of the advected ®eld at the departure point is obtained by interpolation. Both the trajectory integration and repeated interpolation in¯uence accuracy. We compare the accuracy and performance of interpolation schemes based on piecewise cubic polynomials and cubic B-splines in the context of a distributed memory, parallel computing environment. The computational cost and interprocessor communication requirements for both methods are reported. Spline interpolation has better conservation properties but requires the solution of a global linear system, initially appearing to hinder a distributed memory implementation. The proposed parallel algorithm for multidimensional spline interpolation has almost the same communication overhead as local piecewise polynomial interpolation. We also compare various techniques for tracking trajectories given different values for the Courant number.

	abstract = {We consider numerical solutions of the two-dimensional non-linear shallow water equations with a bed slope source term. These equations are well-suited for the study of many geophysical phenomena, including coastal engineering where wetting and drying processes are commonly observed. To accurately describe the evolution of moving shorelines over strongly varying topography, we ﬁrst investigate two well-balanced methods of Godunov-type, relying on the resolution of non-homogeneous Riemann problems. But even if these schemes were previously proved to be efﬁcient in many simulations involving occurrences of dry zones, they fail to compute accurately moving shorelines. From this, we investigate a new model, called {SURF} {WB}, especially designed for the simulation of wave transformations over strongly varying topography. This model relies on a recent reconstruction method for the treatment of the bed-slope source term and is able to handle strong variations of topography and to preserve the steady states at rest. In addition, the use of the recent {VFRoe}-ncv Riemann solver leads to a robust treatment of wetting and drying phenomena. An adapted ‘second order’ reconstruction generates accurate bore-capturing abilities. This scheme is validated against several analytical solutions, involving varying topography, time dependent moving shorelines and convergences toward steady states. This model should have an impact in the prediction of 2D moving shorelines over strongly irregular topography. Copyright q 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This paper examines the various spatial interpolation methods used in interpolating river channel bathymetry. Commonly used interpolation methods, namely inverse distance weighting, spline (tension and regularized), natural neighbor, {TopoGrid}, and ordinary kriging (isotropic and anisotropic) are evaluated within the {ArcGIS} environment by using root mean square error ({RMSE}) criteria. To study the anisotropic effects, the interpolation methods are evaluated in two different coordinate systems: a Cartesian (x, y) coordinate system and a ﬂow-oriented (s, n) coordinate system. Using the data from the Brazos River in Texas, it is shown that {TopoGrid}, natural neighbor and ordinary kriging, which do not account of anisotropy in the data, performed better than anisotropic kriging in the Cartesian coordinate system. In the ﬂow-oriented coordinate system, the performance of anisotropic spatial interpolation methods is signiﬁcantly better (40\% reduction in {RMSE}) compared to the isotropic interpolation methods. A modiﬁed version of inverse distance weighting method, called elliptical inverse distance weighting ({EIDW}), is developed to account for river anisotropy. The {RMSE} results from application of {EIDW} are close to that from anisotropic kriging, thus providing a simple and computationally faster alternative to complex kriging methods.},

	abstract = {Continuous surface of river bathymetry (bed topography) is typically produced by spatial interpolation of discrete point or cross-section data. Several interpolation methods that do not account for spatial trend in river bathymetry produce inaccurate surfaces, thus requiring complex interpolation methods such as anisotropic kriging. Although isotropic methods are unsuitable for interpolating river bathymetry, issues that limit their use remain unaddressed. This paper addresses the issue of effect of spatial trend in river bathymetry on isotropic interpolation methods. It is hypothesized that if the trend is removed from the data before interpolation, the results from isotropic methods should be comparable with anisotropic methods. Data from six river reaches in the United States are used to: (i) interpolate bathymetry data using seven spatial interpolation methods; (ii) separate trend from bathymetry; (iii) interpolate residuals (bathymetry minus trend) by using all seven interpolation methods to get residual surfaces, (iv) add the trend back to residual surfaces; and (v) compare resulting surfaces from (iv) with surfaces created in (i). Quantitative and qualitative comparison of results through root mean square error ({RMSE}), semi-variograms, and cross-section proﬁles show that signiﬁcant improvement (as much as 60\% in {RMSE}) can be accomplished in spatial interpolation of river bathymetry by separating trend from the data. Although this paper provides a new simple way for interpolating river bathymetry by using (otherwise deemed inappropriate) isotropic methods, the choice of trend function and spatial arrangement of discrete bathymetry data play a vital role in successful implementation of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {The structure of the salinity ﬁeld in northern San Francisco Bay and how it is affected by freshwater ﬂow are discussed. Two datasets are examined: the ﬁrst is 23 years of daily salinity data taken by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation along the axis of northern San Francisco Bay; the second is a set of salinity transects taken by the U.S. Geological Survey between 1988 and 1993. Central to this paper is a measure of salinity intrusion, X2: the distance from the Golden Gate Bridge to where the bottom salinity is 2 psu. Using X2 to scale distance, the authors ﬁnd that for most ﬂow conditions, the mean salinity distribution of the estuary is nearly self-similar with a salinity gradient in the center 70\% of the region between the Golden Gate and X2 that is proportional to {XϪ}2 1. Analysis of covariability of Q and X2 showed a characteristic timescale of adjustment of the salinity ﬁeld of approximately 2 weeks. The steady-state response deduced from the X2 time series implies that X2 is proportional to riverﬂow to the 1/7 power. This relation, which differs from the standard 1/3 power dependence that is derived theoretically assuming constant exchange coefﬁcients, shows that the upstream salt ﬂux associated with gravitational circulation is more sensitive to the longitudinal salinity gradient than theory supposes. This is attributed to the strengthening of stratiﬁcation caused by the stronger longitudinal salinity gradient that accompanies larger river ﬂows.},

	abstract = {Applications of transport time scales are pervasive in biological, hydrologic, and geochemical studies yet these times scales are not consistently defined and applied with rigor in the literature. We compare three transport time scales (flushing time, age, and residence time) commonly used to measure the retention of water or scalar quantities transported with water. We identify the underlying assumptions associated with each time scale, describe procedures for computing these time scales in idealized cases, and identify pitfalls when real-world systems deviate from these idealizations. We then apply the time scale definitions to a shallow 378 ha tidal lake to illustrate how deviations between real water bodies and the idealized examples can result from: (1) non-steady flow; (2) spatial variability in bathymetry, circulation, and transport time scales; and (3) tides that introduce complexities not accounted for in the idealized cases. These examples illustrate that no single transport time scale is valid for all time periods, locations, and constituents, and no one time scale describes all transport processes. We encourage aquatic scientists to rigorously define the transport time scale when it is applied, identify the underlying assumptions in the application of that concept, and ask if those assumptions are valid in the application of that approach for computing transport time scales in real systems.},

	abstract = {Watershed models are powerful tools for simulating the effect of watershed processes and management on soil and water resources. However, no comprehensive guidance is available to facilitate model evaluation in terms of the accuracy of simulated data compared to measured flow and constituent values. Thus, the objectives of this research were to: (1) determine recommended model evaluation techniques (statistical and graphical), (2) review reported ranges of values and corresponding performance ratings for the recommended statistics, and (3) establish guidelines for model evaluation based on the review results and project-specific considerations; all of these objectives focus on simulation of streamflow and transport of sediment and nutrients. These objectives were achieved with a thorough review of relevant literature on model application and recommended model evaluation methods. Based on this analysis, we recommend that three quantitative statistics, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ({NSE}), percent bias ({PBIAS}), and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data ({RSR}), in addition to the graphical techniques, be used in model evaluation. The following model evaluation performance ratings were established for each recommended statistic. In general, model simulation can be judged as satisfactory if {NSE} {\textgreater} 0.50 and {RSR} {\textless} 0.70, and if {PBIAS} + 25\% for streamflow, {PBIAS} + 55\% for sediment, and {PBIAS} + 70\% for N and P. For {PBIAS}, constituent-specific performance ratings were determined based on uncertainty of measured data. Additional considerations related to model evaluation guidelines are also discussed. These considerations include: single-event simulation, quality and quantity of measured data, model calibration procedure, evaluation time step, and project scope and magnitude. A case study illustrating the application of the model evaluation guidelines is also provided.},

	abstract = {Usually non-stationary numerical calculations are based on the hyperbolic evolution equations for the electric and magnetic elds. To avoid the increase of errors in Gauss' law, often a subsequent divergence cleaning step is added solving a Poisson equation for a correction potential. This is especially important in the simulation of the self-consistent movement of charged particles in electromagnetic elds. In this context it is a well-known fact, that the approximation of the particle motion introduce numerical errors and, consequently, the charge conservation equation is not satis ed. In this paper, a new method for incorporating Gauss' law into non-stationary electromagnetic simulation codes is developed, starting from a constrained formulation of the Maxwell equations. This system is a purely hyperbolic one, where the divergence errors propagate with the speed of light to the boundary of the computational domain. This extended hyperbolic system is treated numerically within the framework of high-resolution nite-volume schemes. The intention of the present paper is to introduce the basic ideas of the numerical approximation concept for the purely hyperbolic approach. Simulation results obtained with this new technique for pure electromagnetic wave propagation and for an electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell computation are presented and compared with other methods.},

The approach described herein retains streamwise convective accelerations in the lowest order momentum equations and, therefore, can be used to investigate flow in, channel bends with curvature and topography that vary significantly in the streamwise direction, as is the case in most natural streams and rivers. The total boundary shear stress field obtained from our computations includes both skin friction and the form drag associated with pressure forces on bars and bedforms. A simple method for removing the form drag component is described, thereby permitting computation of the bottom stress responsible for sediment transport. Results of our calculations are compared to measurements obtained in Muddy Creek, a sand-bedded meandering stream in Wyoming possessing the characteristics typical of natural channels. Model predictions of velocity, boundary shear stress, and surface elevation are shown to be in excellent agreement with the measurements, primarily due to the careful treatment of convective accelerations in the governing equations.},

At the downstream station, where the turbulence intensity was low, both {ADCPs} reproduced the mean velocity proﬁle well away from the ﬂume boundaries; errors near the boundaries were due to transducer ringing, ﬂow disturbance, and sidelobe interference. At the upstream station, where the turbulence intensity was higher, errors in the mean velocity were large.

The data cover a time scale of diffusionranging from 2 hr to 1 month and a length scale from 30 m to 100 km. Two kinds of' diffusion diagrams' are prepared; one showing horizontal variance versus diffusion time and the other showing apparent diffusivity versus the scale of diffusion. The overall behaviors of the horizontal variance and of the apparent diffusivityare evidently different from those whichthe similaritytheory of turbulence deduces. However,there still remains a possibility that the similarity theory may be valid locally with different values of the rate of turbulent energy dissipation. The diagrams provide a practical means to predict the rate of horizontal spread of substance from an instantaneous source.},

	abstract = {Load balance is critical for performance in large parallel applications. An imbalance on today’s fastest supercomputers can force hundreds of thousands of cores to idle, and on future exascale machines this cost will increase by over a factor of a thousand. Improving load balance requires a detailed understanding of the amount of computational load per process and an application’s simulated domain, but no existing metrics sufﬁciently account for both factors. Current load balance mechanisms are often integrated into applications and make implicit assumptions about the load. Some strategies place the burden of providing accurate load information, including the decision on when to balance, on the application. Existing application-independent mechanisms simply measure the application load without any knowledge of application elements, which limits them to identifying imbalance without correcting it. Our novel load model couples abstract application information with scalable measurements to derive accurate and actionable load metrics. Using these metrics, we develop a cost model for correcting load imbalance. Our model enables comparisons of the effectiveness of load balancing algorithms in any speciﬁc imbalance scenario. Our model correctly selects the algorithm that achieves the lowest runtime in up to 96\% of the cases, and can achieve a 19\% gain over selecting a single balancing algorithm for all cases.},

	abstract = {A simple k–e turbulence closure is introduced which has no stability functions but instead a Richardson number-dependent turbulent Prandtl number. Its free parameters are determined in a comparison with microstructure observations from a stratiﬁed and sheared tidal estuary and laboratory measurements. The closure is able to simulate observed turbulent dissipation rates (e) and turbulent length scales (lth) in regions of strong mean shear and small gradient Richardson number (Rg) to within factors of 2–3. It fails in regions of small shear and large Rg, presumably because of the dominance of internal wave-driven mixing. Additional simulations with a k–e closure with stability functions taken from Canuto et al. [Canuto, V.M., Howard, A., Cheng, Y., Dubovikov, M.S., 2001. Ocean turbulence I: one-point closure model. Momentum and heat vertical diﬀusivities. J. Phys. Oceanogr. 31, 1413–1426] and with the closure of Baumert and Peters [Baumert, H., Peters, H., 2004. Turbulence closure, steady state, and collapse into waves. J. Phys. Oceanogr. 34, 505–512] show poor performance. Establishing a valid 1:1 comparison of simulated and observed e and lth requires nudging the model velocity and density toward observed values because free model integrations quickly diverge from the observations. Steady state gradient Richardson numbers are constrained to a range of 0.18–0.25, while ﬂux Richardson numbers are constrained to the range of 0.1–0.22. The closure output is rather insensitive to such parameter variations. The simulations are sensitive, however, to the treatment of the observed velocity and density used to nudge the model. Good closure performance requires averaging the measured tidal ﬂow over about an hour, a time scale for which conventional numerical models of estuarine circulations should be able to match observed shears. In the closure simulations the {TKE} balance stays close to a production–dissipation balance. The time rate of change and vertical diﬀusion of {TKE} are small, of the same order of magnitude, and vary in magnitude relative to each other systematically across the water column.},

We also introduce a second-order, unsplit, volume-of-ﬂuid advection algorithm that is based on a second-order, ﬁnite diﬀerence method for scalar conservation laws due to Bell, Dawson and Shubin. We test this advection algorithm by modeling several diﬀerent interface shapes propagating in two simple incompressible ﬂows and compare the results with the standard second-order, operator-split advection algorithm. Although both methods are second-order accurate when the interface is smooth, we ﬁnd that the unsplit algorithm exhibits noticeably better resolution in regions where the interface has discontinuous derivatives, such as at corners.},

	abstract = {In intertidal regions with subtidal channels, effects of bathymetry on overlying ﬂow vary greatly with tidal stage. Around low water when mudﬂats and marsh are exposed, ﬂow is constrained to channels, but when water depths are greater, tidal forcing may not necessarily be aligned with meandering channel axes. Flow across the channel can generate strong shear and turbulence at the elevation of the channel banks and can signiﬁcantly increase turbulent energy in the middle of the water column. Field observations in a mudﬂat channel of San Francisco Bay indicate that cross-channel shear regularly occurs there early in ebb tides. With increased freshwater ﬂow, baroclinic forcing can enhance shear by decoupling ﬂow between dense water ﬂooding in the channel and fresher water ebbing above the channel banks. A water column numerical model with k-ε turbulence closure is modiﬁed to represent the cross-channel shear production. Numerical results with uniform density indicate that turbulence production increases with the angle between the barotropic tidal forcing and the channel axis. When a longitudinal salinity gradient is imposed, cross-channel shear production contributes to breakdown of periodic stratiﬁcation. Turbulence produced at the channel banks locally exceeds dissipation, and the excess energy is either lost to buoyancy or diffuses vertically to lower energy regions near the surface and near the bed. The balance among shear production, buoyancy production, and diffusion of turbulence depends on the ﬂow angle and the strength of the longitudinal salinity gradient.},

	abstract = {Measurements of downstream and cross-stream velocities at a small, asymmetrical stream confluence show that the structure of low-stage flows is influenced by the tributary/main stem momentum flux ratio, the total discharge of the incoming flows, and the bed morphology. Flow accelerates through the confluence during all three measured events. This acceleration is associated with a downstream reduction in channel capacity caused in part by the presence of a large bar along the inner bank of the downstream channel. As the momentum ratio increases, flow from the lateral tributary increasingly deflects flow from the main stream toward the outer channel bank within the confluence. As a result, the mixing interface between the converging flows also shifts outward. The large bar in the downstream channel deflects flow along the inner bank toward the adjacent scour hole, enhancing flow convergence downstream of the confluence and producing a region of flow separation adjacent to, or in the lee of the bar. The loci of maximum topographic deflection and flow separation vary with momentum ratio and total discharge. Secondary circulation within the downstream channel is characterized by a single large helical cell when the momentum ratio exceeds one, and weak surface-convergent helical cells on opposite sides of the mixing interface when the momentum ratio is less than one. Curvature of the flow, and thus the strength of helical motion, is greatest on the tributary side of the mixing interface. Although the flow events measured in this study did not exceed the threshold for sediment movement, the bed morphology at the confluence can be explained by the flow structure observed during these low-stage events, suggesting that formative flows may have similar downstream and cross-stream velocity fields.},

	abstract = {Previous process-oriented ﬁeld studies of stream conﬂuences have focused mainly on ﬂuvial dynamics at or immediately downstream of the location where the conﬂuent ﬂows enter the downstream channel. This study examines in detail the spatial evolution of the time-averaged downstream velocity, cross-stream velocity, and temperature ﬁelds between the junction apex, where the ﬂows initially meet, and the entrance to the downstream channel. A well-deﬁned, vertically oriented mixing interface exists within this portion of the conﬂuence, suggesting that lateral mixing of the incoming ﬂows is limited. The downstream velocity ﬁeld near the junction apex is characterized by two high-velocity cores separated by an intervening region of low-velocity or recirculating ﬂuid. In the downstream direction, the high-velocity cores move inwards towards the mixing interface and high-velocity ﬂuid progressively extends downwards into a zone of scour, resulting in an increase in ﬂow velocity in the centre of the conﬂuence. The cross-stream velocity ﬁeld is dominated by ﬂow convergence, but also includes a component associated with a consistent pattern of secondary circulation. This pattern is characterized by two surface-convergent helical cells, one on each side of the mixing interface. The helical cells appear to be the mechanism by which high-momentum ﬂuid near the surface is advected downwards into the zone of scour. For transport-ineffective ﬂows, the dimensions and intensities of the cells are controlled by the momentum ratio of the conﬂuent streams and by the extant bed morphology within the conﬂuence. Although the ﬂow structure of formative events was not measured directly in this study, documented patterns of erosion and deposition within the central region of the conﬂuence suggest that these events are dynamically similar to the measured ﬂows, except for the fact that formative ﬂows are not constrained by, but can reshape, the bed morphology. The results of this investigation are consistent with and augment previous ﬁndings on time-averaged ﬂow structure in the downstream portion of the conﬂuence. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

(1999) `Time averaged flow structure in the central region of a stream confluence: a discussion', Earth Surface Processes and Landforms, 24, 361±367 we show that our method for decomposing the crossstream velocity field into components associated with primary and secondary velocities, as defined by Rozovskii, is not flawed or misleading. Instead, it yields valuable information that illustrates the contribution of secondary circulation and, by inference, helical motion to the pattern of cross-stream flow at confluences. Lane et al.'s concern about our methodology can be attributed to their failure to distinguish clearly and consistently between secondary circulation and cross-stream discharge, a distinction that is central to our method of analysis, and to their inappropriate comparisons of velocity fields for the different frames of reference associated with secondary circulation and cross-stream discharge.

A ﬂood-ebb tidal asymmetry in turbulent kinetic energy exists such that {TKE} during ﬂooding currents is greater than during ebbing currents with similar magnitudes. This review analyzes two papers: a ﬁeld study and scaling model arguing that buoyancy production induced by diﬀerential advection on ﬂood tides is an important source of turbulence, and an {LES} model study whose results indicate that diﬀerences in shear production cause the ﬂood-ebb asymmetry and that buoyancy is unimportant. Diﬀerences between the ﬁeld and model conditions indicate that the model results may not be directly comparable to the ﬁeld observations. A synthesis between the two results is obtained by noticing that both studies seem to show that buoyancy production is important at certain locations within the water column, namely near the bottom boundary layer interface, while it may be unimportant in a tidally-integrated sense.},

The vertical structure approximated to linear stress proﬁles decreasing from maximum values near the bed to almost zero stresses just below the surface.

A 25-h series of measurements of the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy (⑀) in the Liverpool Bay region of freshwater inﬂuence ({ROFI}) have revealed the form of this interaction and indicate substantial differences from regions where horizontal gradients are weak. In the {ROFI} system there is a pronounced difference between ﬂood and ebb regimes. During the ebb the water column stratiﬁes and strong dissipation is conﬁned to the lower half of the water column. By contrast, during the ﬂood, stratiﬁcation is eroded with complete vertical mixing occurring at high water and high values of dissipation (3 {mW} {mϪ}3) extending throughout the water column. The cycle of dissipation is therefore predominantly semidiurnal in the upper layers whereas, near the bottom boundary, the principal variation is at the M4 frequency as observed in regions of horizontal uniformity. Toward the end of the ﬂood phase of the cycle, tidal straining produces instabilities in the water column that release additional energy for convective mixing. Conﬁrmation of increased vertical motions throughout the water column during the late ﬂood and at high water is provided by measurements of vertical velocity and the error velocity from a bottom-mounted acoustic Doppler current proﬁler.},

The solution is based on the full non-linearised St. Venant equations applied to an exponentially converging channel, which may have a bottom slope. Two families of solutions exist. The first family consists of mixed tidal waves, which have a phase lag between zero and π/2, which occur in alluvial coastal-plane estuaries with almost no bottom slope; the second family consists of "apparent standing" waves, which develop in short estuaries with a steep topography. Asymptotic solutions are presented for progressive waves, frictionless waves, waves in channels with constant cross-section, and waves in ideal estuaries where there is no damping or amplification. The analytical method is accurate in the downstream, marine, part of estuaries and particularly useful in combination with ecological or salt intrusion models.

Eventually, as the graph evolves, it becomes necessary to correct the partition in accordance with the structural changes in the computation. Partitioning the graph from scratch and then intelligently remapping the resulting partition will accomplish this task. Two different types of schemes to accomplish this task have been developed recently. In one scheme, the graph is partitioned from scratch and then the resulting partition is remapped intelligently to the original partition. The second type of scheme use a multilevel diffusion repartitioner. In this paper, we conduct a comparison study on repartitioning via intelligent remapping versus repartitioning by diffusion. We show that multilevel diffusion algorithms generally produce signiﬁcantly lower data migration overhead for adaptive graphs in which low magnitude localized or non-localized imbalances occur and for graphs in which high magnitude imbalances occurs globally throughout the domains than partitioning from scratch and remapping the resulting partition. We show that for the class of problems in which high magnitude imbalances occur in localized areas of the graph, partitioning from scratch and remapping the resulting partition will result in very low edge-cuts and data migration overheads which are similar to those obtained by diffusive schemes. Finally, we show that the run times of the various schemes are all similar.},

	abstract = {Measurements collected in the York River estuary, Virginia, demonstrate the important impact that tidal and lateral asymmetries in turbulent mixing have on the tidally averaged residual circulation. A reduction in turbulent mixing during the ebb phase of the tide caused by tidal straining of the axial density gradient results in increased vertical velocity shear throughout the water column during the ebb tide. In the absence of significant lateral differences in turbulent mixing, the enhanced ebb-directed transport caused by tidal straining is balanced by a reduction in the net seaward-directed barotropic pressure gradient, resulting in laterally uniform two-layer residual flow. However, the channel–shoal morphology of many drowned river valley estuaries often leads to lateral gradients in turbulent mixing. Tidal straining may then lead to tidal asymmetries in turbulent mixing near the deeper channel while the neighboring shoals remain relatively well mixed. As a result, the largest lateral asymmetries in turbulent mixing occur at the end of the ebb tide when the channel is significantly more stratified than the shoals. The reduced friction at the end of ebb delays the onset of the flood tide, increasing the duration of ebb in the channel. Conversely, over the shoal regions where stratification is more inhibited by tidal mixing, there is greater friction and the transition from ebb to flood occurs more rapidly. The resulting residual circulation is seaward over the channel and landward over the shoal. The shoal–channel segregation of this barotropically induced estuarine residual flow is opposite to that typically associated with baroclinic estuarine circulation over channel–shoal bathymetry.},

Contrary to previous ﬁndings that suggest wind stress acts predominantly as a source of energy to mix away estuarine stratiﬁcation, our results demonstrate that the wind can play a more important role in straining the alongchannel estuarine density gradient. Down-estuary winds enhance the tidally-averaged vertical shear, which interacts with the along-channel density gradient to increase vertical stratiﬁcation. Up-estuary winds tend to reduce, or even reverse the vertical shear, reducing vertical stratiﬁcation. In two experiments each lasting approximately a month, the estuarine exchange ﬂow was highly correlated with the along-channel component of the wind. The changes in stratiﬁcation caused by the exchange ﬂow appear to control the amount of vertical mixing as parameterized by the vertical eddy viscosity. The degree of stratiﬁcation induced by wind straining also appears to play an important role in controlling the effectiveness of wind and tidal mixing.},

	abstract = {In most estuarine systems it is assumed that the dominant along-channel momentum balance is between the integrated pressure gradient and bed stress. Scaling the amplitude of the estuarine circulation based on this balance has been shown to have predictive skill. However, a number of authors recently highlighted important nonlinear processes that contribute to the subtidal dynamics at leading order. In this study, a previously validated numerical model of the Hudson River estuary is used to examine the forces driving the residual estuarine circulation and to test the predictive skill of two linear scaling relationships. Results demonstrate that the nonlinear advective acceleration terms contribute to the subtidal along-channel momentum balance at leading order. The contribution of these nonlinear terms is driven largely by secondary lateral ﬂows. Under a range of forcing conditions in the model runs, the advective acceleration terms nearly always act in concert with the baroclinic pressure gradient, reinforcing the residual circulation. Despite the strong contribution of the nonlinear advective terms to the subtidal dynamical balance, a linear scaling accurately predicts the strength of the observed residual circulation in the model. However, this result is largely fortuitous, as this scaling does not account for two processes that are fundamental to the estuarine circulation. The skill of this scaling results because of the compensatory relationship between the contribution of the advective acceleration terms and the suppression of turbulence due to density stratiﬁcation. Both of these processes, neither of which is accounted for in the linear scaling, increase the residual estuarine circulation but have an opposite dependence on tidal amplitude and, consequently, strength of stratiﬁcation.},

On the shelf, the form number of the water levels and currents are approximately equal (6-7), while currents in the tidal inlets to Mississippi Sound have form numbers less than half that of the corresponding water levels. Most of the variation in current form number can be explained by a change from a two- to a onedimensional flow field. Theoretical form numbers derived for Sverdrup waves and uniform flow through an inlet indicate continuity causes semidiurnal currents to increase rel-ative to diurnal currents at the inlets and results in the reduced current form number. Water levels are not affected by the continuity constraint. Variations in the observed current form numbers from theoretical values are caused by compound tides and overtides of the diurnal constituents, which have contaminated the harmonic constant estimates of semidiurnal currents. The K2/K1 ratio (K2 representing the first harmonic of Ki generated locally) is estimated to be 0.3 in the inlet currents, and the two waves differ in phase by 180*. The enhancement of semidiurnal currents should occur in most tidal inlets bordering mixed or diurnal seas.},

Comparison of the results show that the dispersion coefﬁcient tensor obtained directly from velocity proﬁles provided a more realistic solution that can describe the abrupt expansion of tracer clouds in the transverse direction. Heterogeneous longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefﬁcients were inversely estimated from the calculated dispersion coefﬁcient tensor based on the velocity proﬁles. Extremely large transverse dispersion coefﬁcients were formed at the apex of the channel bend, where there was a well-developed secondary current.

A mass budget of total mercury ({THg}) quantiﬁes sources and storage for particular areas — knowledge that is required for understanding of management options in lowland ﬂoodplains. In order to assess contaminant risk in the largest ﬂood-control bypass, prime wetland, and restoration target in the Sacramento River basin, we estimated empirical relationships between {THg}, suspended sediment concentration ({SSC}), and streamﬂow (Q) for each of the major inputs and outputs using data from various publicly available sources. These relationships were improved by incorporating statistical representations of the dynamics of seasonal and intra-ﬂood exhaustion (hysteresis) of sediment and mercury. Using continuous records of Q to estimate {SSC} suspended sediment ﬂux and {SSC} to estimate {THg} ﬂux, we computed the net transfer of sediment-adsorbed mercury through the Yolo Bypass over a decade, 1993–2003. Flood control weirs spilling Sacramento River ﬂoodwaters into the bypass deliver {\textasciitilde} 75\% of the water and {\textasciitilde} 50\% of the river's suspended sediment load, while one Coast Range tributary of the bypass, Cache Creek, contributes twice the {THg} load of the mainstem Sacramento. Although estimated sediment ﬂux entering Yolo Bypass is balanced by efﬂux to the Sacramento/San Francisco Bay-Delta, there is much evidence of deposition and remobilization of sediment in Yolo Bypass during ﬂooding. These factors point to the importance of the bypass as sedimentary reservoir and as an evolving substrate for biogeochemical processing of heavy metals. The estimates of mercury ﬂux suggest net deposition of {\textasciitilde} 500 kg in the 24,000 ha ﬂoodway over a decade, dominated by two large ﬂoods, representing a storage reservoir for this important contaminant.},

The quantification of profiles of Reynolds stresses simultaneous with the measurement of mean velocity profiles allows for extensive analysis of the turbulence of the flow. In this paper, we examine the relation between the turbulence and the mean flow through the calculation of u*, the friction velocity, and c d , the coefficient of drag. Finally, we calculate quantities of particular interest in turbulence modeling and analysis, the characteristic lengthscales, including a lengthscale which represents the stream-wise scale of the eddies which dominate the Reynolds stresses.},

	abstract = {The creation of residual flows in estuaries is examined using acoustic Doppler current profiler data sets from northern San Francisco Bay. The data sets are analyzed using principal component analysis to examine the temporal variability of the flows which create the residual circulation. It is seen that in this periodically and partially stratified estuary the residual flows are created through a series of pulses with strong variability at the 24-hour timescale, through the interaction of shear, stratification and mixing. This interaction is captured through the use of a dimensionless number, the horizontal Richardson number (Rix), which is developed to examine the local balance between the stratifying and destratifying forces at the tidal timescale. It is seen that Rix is a valuable parameter in predicting the onset of the residual-creating events, with a threshold value of{\textasciitilde} 3 on ebb tides. This critical value is argued to be a threshold, above which the stratification and shear flow create a feedback effect, each further intensifying the other. This feedback results in a highly variable exchange flow which creates the estuarine residual in intermittent pulses rather than as a steady flow. Although typically attributed to baroclinic forcing, an argument is made that these pulses of residual-creating exchange flow could be created by barotropic forcing in the presence of variable stratification which is asymmetric between flood and ebb tides.

	abstract = {A two-week dataset from a partially and periodically stratified estuary quantifies variability in the turbulence across the tidal and spring–neap time scales. These observations have been fit with a twoparameter model of the Reynolds stress profile, which produces estimates of the time variation of the bottom boundary layer height and the friction velocity. Conditions at the top of the bottom boundary layer indicate that the dynamics governing the development of the estuarine bottom boundary layer are different on ebb tides than on flood tides. The asymmetry in the flow is explained by consideration of the straininduced buoyancy flux, which is stabilizing on ebb tides and destabilizing on flood tides. Based on these observations, a scaling approach to estimating estuarine bottom boundary layer parameters (height and friction velocity) is presented, which includes a modified Monin–Obukhov length scale to account for the horizontal buoyancy flux created by the sheared advection. Comparison with the observations of boundary layer height and friction velocity suggests that this approach may be successful in predicting bottom boundary layer parameters in estuaries and coastal regions with significant horizontal buoyancy fluxes. Comparison between the strain-induced buoyancy flux and shear production indicates that the straining of the density field is an important contributor to the turbulent kinetic energy budget and creates an asymmetry in turbulent energy between ebb and flood tides. It appears that the structure of the turbulence, specifically the ratio of the Reynolds stress to the turbulent energy, is also modified by tidal straining, further accentuating the ebb–flood asymmetries.},

	abstract = {Observations of turbulent stresses and mean velocities over an entire spring–neap cycle are used to evaluate the dynamics of tidally averaged ﬂows in a partially stratiﬁed estuarine channel. In a depth-averaged sense, the net ﬂow in this channel is up estuary due to interaction of tidal forcing with the geometry of the larger basin. The depth-variable tidally averaged ﬂow has the form of an estuarine exchange ﬂow (downstream at the surface, upstream at depth) and varies in response to the neap–spring transition. The weakening of the tidally averaged exchange during the spring tides appears to be a result of decreased stratiﬁcation on the tidal time scale rather than changes in bed stress. The dynamics of the estuarine exchange ﬂow are deﬁned by a balance between the vertical divergence of the tidally averaged turbulent stress and the tidally averaged pressure gradient in the lower water column. In the upper water column, tidal stresses are important contributors, particularly during the neap tides. The usefulness of an effective eddy viscosity in the tidally averaged momentum equation is explored, and it is seen that the effective eddy viscosity on the subtidal time scale would need to be negative to close the momentum balance. This is due to the dominant contribution of tidally varying turbulent momentum ﬂuxes, which have no speciﬁc relation to the subtidal circulation. Using a water column model, the validity of an effective eddy viscosity is explored; for periodically stratiﬁed water columns, a negative effective viscosity is required.},

Numerical experiments were carried out on several example problems to demonstrate the superior accuracy and efﬁciency of the proposed particle tracking technique over Cheng’s and Pollock’s methods. The numerical results show that the use of a linear temporal interpolation of velocity can allow an increase in time step size without causing a signiﬁcant decrease in accuracy, particularly under a complicated transient ﬂow or a rapidly changing velocity ﬁeld with time.},

The stochastic cycle models allow for a ﬂexible description of periodic behaviour in time series data. In the frequency domain, a wide variety of peaked spectral shapes, characteristic of time-varying cyclical dynamics, is produced. The parameters have a direct interpretation, so cyclical behaviour may be studied directly; in a Bayesian approach, the researcher may implement prior views on the period in a consistent way. Extensions to multivariate models are possible.},

The analysis focuses on testing 1) a simpliﬁed turbulent kinetic energy equation, in which production balances dissipation; 2) the Prandtl–Karman law of the wall, which is a relationship between bottom stress and near-bottom velocity gradient; and 3) a simpliﬁed depth-integrated along-channel momentum balance involving local acceleration, pressure gradient, and bottom stress. Estimates of production and dissipation agree well throughout the entire record. The relationship between bottom stress and velocity gradient is consistent with the law of the wall within approximately 1 m of the seaﬂoor during ﬂooding tides, but it departs from the law of the wall at greater heights during ﬂooding tides and at all resolved heights during ebbing tides. The local stratiﬁcation is too small to explain this effect, and the likely explanation is suppression of the turbulent length scale by the ﬁnite thickness of the relatively well-mixed layer beneath the pycnocline. Direct covariance estimates of bottom stress close the approximate momentum balance well during some periods, but are often smaller than the sum of the other terms in the balance by a factor of roughly up to 2. The agreement between stress estimates and the sum of the other terms is best during periods of strongest top-to-bottom stratiﬁcation and worst during periods of weak stratiﬁcation, for reasons that are not understood.},

We show that this constraint is particularly well suited for the preservation of thin structures in an image restoration process. A direct link is made between our proposed equation and a continuous formulation of the {LIC}’s (Line Integral Convolutions by Cabral and Leedom [11]). It leads to the design of a very fast and stable algorithm that implements our regularization method, by successive integrations of pixel values along curved integral lines. Besides, the scheme numerically performs with a sub-pixel accuracy and preserves then thin image structures better than classical ﬁnite-differences discretizations. Finally, we illustrate the efﬁciency of our generic curvature-preserving approach - in terms of speed and visual quality - with different comparisons and various applications requiring image smoothing : color images denoising, inpainting and image resizing by nonlinear interpolation.},

Classical and recent turbulence models are reformulated using a unifying notation, making differences in model structure and model parameters more transparent. The essential characteristics of a number of models are compared. It is further demonstrated that the mathematical stability and realisability of the models is crucial for practical applications. The parameter constraints to insure stable computations are discussed. Model performance is evaluated for a number of idealised entrainment scenarios that are typical for shelf seas: entrainment in linearly stratiﬁed and twolayer ﬂuids caused by (a) surface wind stress (b) bottom stress due to water motion driven by a barotropic pressure gradient (c) bottom stress due to water motion in a bottom jet. It is shown that the predicted entrainment velocities are in good agreement with available laboratory data, provided the models have been calibrated according to a theoretical constraint. In addition, model behaviour in free convection is re-analysed with the help of recent data from large eddy simulations ({LES}). It is shown that even the most simple models, which do not solve a differential equation for the turbulent kinetic energy ({TKE}), can approximately reproduce the entrainment depth, however, they fail completely in reproducing the correct budget of the {TKE}-balance. In contrast, second-order models solving transport equations for the {TKE} and a length scale determining variable are in reasonable agreement with the {TKE}-budgets from {LES}.},

Residual currents are simulated at a deep (15 m) station in the lower reaches, which possesses a small tidal amplitude to depth ratio and a nonzero salinity throughout the tidal cycle, as well as at a shallow station in the upper reaches, which varies in depth from 1 m at low water, when salinity is zero, to 5 m at high water. A slow, up-estuary current dominates the residual circulation just beneath the high-water level at the deeper station. Further down the water column a down-estuary residual current develops which is the near-surface component of a two-layer gravitational circulation. The up-estuary component of this gravitational circulation occurs deeper in the column and extends to the bed at the deep station, whereas at the shallow station it is eventually dominated by a down-estuary current in the bottom 1 m. Simulated residual currents are fairly insensitive to estuary-bed slope and to observed depth variations in longitudinal density gradient. Residual current profiles of the observed form can only be generated by a longitudinal density gradient. The reduction in vertical eddy viscosity by water column stability due to stratification is an essential requirement for producing a strong gravitational circulation of the observed magnitude. Stratification at the shallow station is much higher during the ebb than during the flood and this asymmetry enhances the gravitational circulation in the upper reaches. The formation of residual flows at both stations is illustrated by showing time-series data over a tidal cycle for the simulated current profiles.},

The original E-M method was accurate in free ﬂow, and when the gate signiﬁcantly controls submerged ﬂow, but for large gate openings with low head loss through the gate, discharge prediction errors were sometimes large ͑approaching 70\%͒. Several empirical factors were investigated with the laboratory data, including the combined upstream energy loss and velocity distribution factor and the submerged ﬂow energy correction. The utility of the existing upstream energy loss and velocity distribution factor relation was extended to larger Reynolds numbers. The relation between the relative energy correction and the relative submergence of the vena contracta was shown to be sensitive to the relative jet thickness. A reﬁned energy correction model was developed, which signiﬁcantly improved the accuracy of submerged ﬂow discharge predictions. Although the focus of this work was radial gates, the energy correction concept and these reﬁnements potentially have application to all submerged sluice gates.},

	abstract = {Estuaries typically have a monotonic increase in salinity from freshwater at the head of the estuary to ocean water at the mouth, creating a consistent direction for the longitudinal baroclinic pressure gradient. However, Mare Island Strait in San Francisco Bay has a local salinity minimum created by the phasing of the currents at the junction of Mare Island and Carquinez Straits. The salinity minimum creates converging baroclinic pressure gradients in Mare Island Strait. Equipment was deployed at four stations in the straits for 6 months from September 1997 to March 1998 to measure tidal variability of velocity, conductivity, temperature, depth, and suspended sediment concentration. Analysis of the measured time series shows that on a tidal time scale in Mare Island Strait, the landward and seaward baroclinic pressure gradients in the local salinity minimum interact with the barotropic gradient, creating regions of enhanced shear in the water column during the ﬂood and reduced shear during the ebb. On a tidally averaged time scale, baroclinic pressure gradients converge on the tidally averaged salinity minimum and drive a converging near-bed and diverging surface current circulation pattern, forming a ‘‘baroclinic convergence zone’’ in Mare Island Strait. Historically large sedimentation rates in this area are attributed to the convergence zone. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

With the increasing availability of spatial observations from remote sensing and intensive ﬁeld studies, the current methods for assessing the spatial component of model predictions need to advance. This paper emphasises the role that spatial ﬁeld comparisons can play in model assessment. A review of the current methods used in hydrology, and other disciplines where spatial ﬁeld comparisons are widely used, reveals some promising methods for quantitatively comparing spatial ﬁelds. These promising approaches––segmentation, importance maps, fuzzy comparison and multiscale comparison––are for local comparison of spatial ﬁelds. They address some of the weaknesses with the current approaches to spatial ﬁeld comparison used in hydrological modelling and, in doing so, emulate some aspects of human visual comparison. The potential of these approaches for assessing spatial predictions and understanding model performance is illustrated with a simple example.},

	abstract = {Feature Flow Fields are a well-accepted approach for extracting and tracking features. In particular, they are often used to track critical points in time-dependent vector ﬁelds and to extract and track vortex core lines. The general idea is to extract the feature or its temporal evolution using a stream line integration in a derived vector ﬁeld – the so-called Feature Flow Field ({FFF}). Hence, the desired feature line is a stream line of the {FFF}. As we will carefully analyze in this paper, the stream lines around this feature line may diverge from it. This creates an unstable situation: if the integration moves slightly off the feature line due to numerical errors, then it will be captured by the diverging neighborhood and carried away from the real feature line. The goal of this paper is to deﬁne a new {FFF} with the guarantee that the neighborhood of a feature line has always converging behavior. This way, we have an automatic correction of numerical errors: if the integration moves slightly off the feature line, it automatically moves back to it during the ongoing integration. This yields results which are an order of magnitude more accurate than the results from previous schemes. We present new stable {FFF} formulations for the main applications of tracking critical points and solving the Parallel Vectors operator. We apply our method to a number of data sets.},

Thus, an existing singularity tracking algorithm devised for planar settings can be applied. The trajectories of the singularities are used as a basis for seeding particles. This leads to a new type of streak line visualization, in which particles are released from a moving source. These generalized streak lines visualize the particles that are ejected from the wall.

	abstract = {Spatio-temporal statistical models are increasingly being used across a wide variety of scientiﬁc disciplines to describe and predict spatially-explicit processes that evolve over time. Correspondingly, in recent years there has been a signiﬁcant amount of research on new statistical methodology for such models. Although descriptive models that approach the problem from the second-order (covariance) perspective are important, and innovative work is being done in this regard, many real-world processes are dynamic, and it can be more efﬁcient in some cases to characterize the associated spatio-temporal dependence by the use of dynamic models. The chief challenge with the speciﬁcation of such dynamical models has been related to the curse of dimensionality. Even in fairly simple linear, ﬁrst-order Markovian, Gaussian error settings, statistical models are often over parameterized. Hierarchical models have proven invaluable in their ability to deal to some extent with this issue by allowing dependency among groups of parameters. In addition, this framework has allowed for the speciﬁcation of science based parameterizations (and associated prior distributions) in which classes of deterministic dynamical models (e.g., partial differential equations ({PDEs}), integro-difference equations ({IDEs}), matrix models, and agent-based models) are used to guide speciﬁc parameterizations. Most of the focus for the application of such models in statistics has been in the linear case. The problems mentioned above with linear dynamic models are compounded in the case of nonlinear models. In this sense, the need for coherent and sensible model parameterizations is not only helpful, it is essential. Here, we present an overview of a framework for incorporating scientiﬁc information to motivate dynamical spatio-temporal models. First, we illustrate the methodology with the linear case. We then develop a general nonlinear spatiotemporal framework that we call general quadratic nonlinearity and demonstrate that it accommodates many different classes of scientiﬁc-based parameterizations as special cases. The model is presented in a hierarchical Bayesian framework and is illustrated with examples from ecology and oceanography.},

	abstract = {The use of acoustic Doppler current proﬁlers ({ADCPs}) to measure turbulent parameters via the variance method involves uncertainties due to instrument noise and ﬂow-related errors in measurement. For weak ﬂows, the uncertainty in Reynolds stress measurements arises mainly from instrument noise and is proportional to the square of the velocity standard deviation, while the uncertainty in the corresponding estimates of the rate of production of turbulent kinetic energy ({TKE}) is proportional to the cube of the velocity standard deviation. For stronger ﬂows, the principal determining parameter is the number of individual independent velocity measurements over which the variance is calculated. These results are validated by detailed analyses of two datasets from an {RD} Instruments 1.2-{MHz} Workhorse {ADCP}, using a ping rate of 2 Hz with ensemble averaging at 0.5 Hz, and a ping rate of 10 Hz with ensemble averaging at 1 Hz, respectively. While increasing ping rate generally reduces the effects of instrument noise, it will not alleviate the inﬂuence of ﬂow-related noise once the sampling interval is less than the autocovariance time scale of the turbulence. Using the fast ping rate, the uncertainty in the Reynolds stress due to instrument noise is reduced by a factor of more than 3 to ϳ0.02 Pa; in higher energy environments there is a reduction in the uncertainty of about 30\%. The observational and theoretical estimates for the reduction in the uncertainty using the fast ping rate are in good agreement.},

Nonlinear feedback via advection of momentum can lead to numerical instability in velocity modes via positive feedback with spurious vertical velocities induced by horizontal divergence truncation error. Existing strategies to mitigate divergence errors such as direct divergence averaging and increased diffusion do not completely mitigate horizontal vertical velocity oscillations. We present a novel elliptic ﬁltering approach to mitigate this spurious error and more accurately represent vertical velocities via improved calculation of horizontal divergences. These results are applied to laminar curved channel ﬂows, demonstrating the applicability of the method to reproduce secondary ﬂow features.},

A unique staggered arrangement of variables enables quite simple computations of momentum equations by avoiding the evaluation of surface pressure and reducing the computational cost of combining cells for the velocity variables. The method successfully reproduces ﬂows over a wide range of slopes, including steep slopes where signiﬁcant errors are observed in a model using conventional terrain-following coordinates. The advantage of horizontal cell combination on extremely steep slopes is also demonstrated.},

A semi-implicit method is used to solve all equations to enhance numerical stability, thus bypassing the most stringent {CFL} restriction on the time step. Further aided algorithmically by an {EulerianLagrangian} solution of the advection terms in the momentum equation and by a simple yet effective inundation algorithm, {SELFE} is very efﬁcient and robust in both quasi-2-D (with two vertical layers) and 3-D modes. A quasi-2-D version of the model is being used to update and expand the characterization of tsunami hazards along the Oregon coast. As a part of a rigorous testing procedure that includes multiple types of coastal problems, we present in this paper a quantitative assessment of performance of the quasi-2-D {SELFE} for two challenging open benchmark problems proposed in the 3rd International Workshop on Long-wave Runup Models. Satisfactory results are obtained for both problems.},

In turn, that mechanism interacts with horizontal shear of residual currents, giving rise to a large effective dispersion in the residual current direction. In "Lagrangian chaos", genuine turbulence is absent and the Eulerian velocity is supposed to be a simple periodic function of time and, whether or not, of the horizontal position. Particletrajectories may then become random functions of time, either by spatial randomness of the Eulerian field, or by the appearance of deterministic chaos in the Euler-Lagrange transformation.},

Its performance has been evaluated using a plane of velocity data obtained from a direct numerical simulation ({DNS}) of a three dimensional plane shear layer. Both the ability to reproduce the vorticity from the exact velocity field and one perturbed by a 5\% random "uncertainty" were assessed. To minimize the sensitivity to velocity uncertainties, a new method was developed using a least-squares approach. The local velocity data is fit to a model velocity field consisting of uniform translation, rigid rotation, a point source, and plane shear. The least-squares method was evaluated in the same manner as the circulation method. The largest differences between the actual and calculated vorticity fields were due to the filter-like nature of the methods. The new method is less sensitive to experimental uncertainty. However the circulation method proved to be slightly better at reproducing the {DNS} field. The least-squares method provides additional information beyond the circulation method results. Using the correlation p'o)o9 and a vorticity threshold criteria to identify regions of rigid rotation (or eddies), the rigid rotation component of the least-squares method indicates these same regions.},

The problem is formulated using the ﬁnite-volume method and care is taken to ensure that the discrete forms have appropriate conservation properties. Two representations of topography, ‘‘partial step’’ and ‘‘piecewise linear,’’ are considered and compared with the staircase approach in some standard problems such as the topographic ␤ effect and ﬂow over a Gaussian bump. It is shown that shaved cells are clearly more accurate than the conventional staircase representation. The use of partial steps, although not as accurate as the piecewise linear approach, is seen to be superior to the staircase approach. Moreover, partial steps can be readily implemented in existing height coordinate models.},

	abstract = {An exact and very general Lagrangian-mean description of the back effect of oscillatory disturbances upon the mean state is given. The basic formalism applies to any problem whose governing equations are given in the usual Eulerian form, and irrespective of whether spatial, temporal, ensemble, or ‘two-timing’ averages are appropriate. The generalized Lagrangian-mean velocity cannot be defined exactly as the ‘mean following a single fluid particle’, but in cases where spatial averages are taken can easily be visualized, for instance, as the motion of the centre of mass of a tube of fluid particles which lay along the direction of averaging in a hypothetical initial state of no disturbance.
            The equations for the Lagrangian-mean flow are more useful than their Eulerian-mean counterparts in significant respects, for instance in explicitly representing the effect upon mean-flow evolution of wave dissipation or forcing. Applications to irrotational acoustic or water waves, and to astrogeophysical problems of waves on axisymmetric mean flows are discussed. In the latter context the equations embody generalizations of the Eliassen-Palm and Charney-Drazin theorems showing the effects on the mean flow of departures from steady, conservative waves, for arbitrary, finite-amplitude disturbances to a stratified, rotating fluid, with allowance for self-gravitation as well as for an external gravitational field.
            The equations show generally how the pseudomomentum (or wave ‘momentum’) enters problems of mean-flow evolution. They also indicate the extent to which the net effect of the waves on the mean flow can be described by a ‘radiation stress’, and provide a general framework for explaining the asymmetry of radiation-stress tensors along the lines proposed by Jones (1973).},

Mean monthly positive {NTR} (associated with low sea level pressure) show no substantial change along the central California coast since 1858 or over the last 50 years. However, in contrast, the highest 2\% of extreme winter {NTR} levels exhibit a signiﬁcant increasing trend since about 1950. Extreme winter {NTR} also show pronounced quasi-periodic decadal-scale variability that is relatively consistent over the last 140 years. Atmospheric sea level pressure anomalies (associated with years having high winter {NTR}) take the form of a distinct, large-scale atmospheric circulation pattern, with intense storminess associated with a broad, southeasterly displaced, deep Aleutian low that directs storm tracks toward the California coast.},

Concepts are explored using a realistic numerical simulation of the Columbia River estuary. The isohaline method is found to be advantageous because it intrinsically highlights the salinity classes in which subtidal volume ﬂux occurs. The resulting expressions give rise to an exact formulation of the time-dependent Knudsen relation and may be used in calculation of the saltwater residence time. The volume ﬂux of the landward transport, which can be calculated precisely using the isohaline framework, is of particular importance for problems in which the saltwater residence time is critical.},

The overall purpose of the work is to point out anomalous data due different causes through a combination of several traditional methods for outliers detection in multivariate datasets and such combination is achieved through a fuzzy inference system. Moreover, the proposed solutions aims to be automatic and self-adaptive, as some parameters which are required for the combination of the different approaches are automatically evaluated by exploiting the available data, without the need of a-priori assumptions or information on a subset of the available data. The proposed method therefore belongs to the class of the unsupervised outliers detection methods. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method, extensive tests have been performed on both a simple case study and a database coming from a real industrial context, where the data have to be ﬁltered before their exploitation for process control purposes. The achieved numerical results are presented and discussed.},

The study consists of experiments during each of the following three “seasons”: winter/spring runoff (March 2002), summer upwelling (July 2003), and autumn relaxation (October 2002). Within each experiment, transects across the channel were repeated approximately every 12 min for 25 h during both spring and neap tides. Velocity was measured from a boatmounted {ADCP}. Scalar concentrations were measured at the surface and from a tow-yoed {SeaSciences} Acrobat. Net salinity exchange rates for each season are quantified with harmonic analysis. Accuracy of the net fluxes is confirmed by comparison with independently measured values. Harmonic results are then decomposed into flux mechanisms using temporal and spatial correlations. In this study, the temporal correlation of cross-sectionally averaged salinity and velocity (tidal pumping flux) is the largest part of the dispersive flux of salinity into the bay. From the tidal pumping flux portion of the dispersive flux, it is shown that there is less exchange than was found in earlier studies. Furthermore, tidal pumping flux scales strongly with freshwater flow resulting from the density-driven movement of a tidally trapped eddy and stratification-induced increases in ebb–flood frictional phasing. Complex bathymetry makes salinity exchange scale differently with flow than would be expected from simple tidal asymmetry and gravitational circulation models.},

	abstract = {Ten methods for numerical simulation of wetting and drying in two-dimensional shallow water flow models, including three new ones, are reviewed and evaluated in this paper. The methods are also applicable to three-dimensional hydrostatic barotropic models based on natural coordinates. The target method should have the following properties: Ži. work in implicit schemes with sufficiently large time steps; Žii. work on Arakawa-C grid with piecewise bilinear ground levels defined on cell sides; Žiii. no excessive wiggles produced by irregular wetting and drying; and Živ. global and local mass conservation. A taxonomy of the methods is first introduced, relevant to: Ži. the criterion for the declaration of the wet or dry status of the cells in the computational mesh, Žii. the effective evaluation of the retention volume in each cell, and Žiii. the computation of water depth between two adjacent cells. Seven existing methods are then checked with test cases of increasing difficulty. By means of simple 1D tests, unphysical behaviours are shown arising from the most common way of computing water depths between cells, as well as from the effective evaluation of the cell retention volume. Three new methods are then introduced to cope with these problems. Also, two methods originally proposed for a different ground model show a major inconsistency with the present ground model and are thus excluded from further comparisons. The eight remaining methods are then checked by means of a severe 2D test case for which an analytical solution is known. Of the three new methods, two proved particularly suitable for practical applications in long-term computations, while the third, besides yielding the most accurate solution, is quite time consuming. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Most estuaries are characterized by non-uniform axial topography with shallow shoals near the mouth. Previous studies have addressed the impacts of the axial topographic variations on mixing and estuarine circulations yet seldom on material transport and retention. This study investigates the longitudinal structure and mechanisms of exchange flow and material transport of Chesapeake Bay ({CB}), featuring a shallow sill in the lower bay, by applying total exchange flow ({TEF}) algorithm, tracer experiments, and partial residence time ({PRT}) using a validated 32-years numerical model simulation. A retention coefficient was adopted to quantify the material retention rate using two characteristic {PRTs}: with and without incorporating water parcels returning to a concerned region. It is found that shoaling from the Rappahannock Shoal to the mouth causes persistent downwelling, strong reflux, and the highest material retention rate in the middle of the bay. The gravitational circulation and the river outflow dominate the transport of salt and riverine dissolved materials ({RDMs}), whereas the contribution of the tidal oscillatory process is localized near the mouth. The dominance of river outflow over the gravitational circulation for transporting {RDMs} is confined within the upper bay, where {PRTs} exhibit distinct seasonality. {PRTs} show small seasonality in the middle to the lower bay controlled by the exchange flow. The present analysis combining {TEF}, efflux/reflux theory, and {PRT} is applicable to other coastal aquatic ecosystems to characterize the water exchange and renewal efficiency along the salinity gradient and understand the contributions of transport to biogeochemical processes.},

The mean age, residence time, and turnover time were computed through a series of numerical model experiments. Both mean age and residence time are functions of freshwater discharge. The model results show that substantial time is required for a substance discharged into the system at the headwaters of the tributaries to be transported to the downstream estuary. It takes about 2 months and 3 months for the substance discharged into the headwaters to be transported to the mouth of the estuary under high ﬂow and mean ﬂow conditions, respectively. The results provide useful information for understanding the transport processes in the estuary and can be used to estimate dissimilative capacity of the estuary for environmental assessment.},

The isohaline analysis averages ﬂuxes in salinity space rather than in physical space, yielding the isohaline exchange ﬂow that incorporates both subtidal and tidal ﬂuxes and precisely satisﬁes the Knudsen relation. The isohaline analysis can be consistently applied to both subtidally and tidally dominated estuaries. In the Hudson, the isohaline exchange ﬂow is similar to results from the Eulerian analysis, and the conventional estuarine theory can be used to quantify the salt transport based on scaling with the baroclinic pressure gradient. In the Merrimack, the isohaline exchange ﬂow is much larger than the Eulerian quantity, indicating the dominance of tidal salt ﬂux. The exchange ﬂow does not scale with the baroclinic pressure gradient but rather with tidal volume ﬂux. This tidal exchange is driven by tidal pumping due to the jet–sink ﬂow at the mouth constriction, leading to a linear dependence of exchange ﬂow on tidal volume ﬂux. Finally, a tidal conversion parameter Qin/Qprism, measuring the fraction of tidal inﬂow Qprism that is converted into net exchange Qin, is proposed to characterize the exchange processes among different systems. It is found that the length scale ratio between tidal excursion and salinity intrusion provides a characteristic to distinguish estuarine regimes.},

This study 1) deﬁnes readily observable dimensionless parameters for establishing the sense and magnitude of gradient Richardson number Ri and eddy viscosity K changes from maximum to minimum stratiﬁcation during a tidal cycle and 2) calculates where representative estuaries ﬁt in this parameter space. The dimensionless parameters are Ri calculated with tidal-averaged stratiﬁcation and shear, scaled stratiﬁcation amplitude, and a scaled shear parameter. The scaled stratiﬁcation amplitude is approximately the tidal amplitude of stratiﬁcation divided by the tidal-averaged stratiﬁcation. The scaled shear parameter depends on the scaled tidal amplitude of shear and the phase difference between the tidal cycles of stratiﬁcation and shear. Over most of the parameter space, Ri is larger at maximum stratiﬁcation. If the scaled stratiﬁcation amplitude falls below a threshold value deﬁned in terms of the scaled shear parameter, shear effects dominate and cause Ri to be greater at minimum stratiﬁcation. Two-thirds of the selected estuary locations have greater Ri at maximum stratiﬁcation. The remaining locations are dominated by shear differences and have an atypical mixing cycle with greater Ri at minimum stratiﬁcation. The Ri and K tidal variations and the position in the parameter space can drastically shift with the spring–neap cycle and spatial variations within an estuary.},

A general deﬁnition and a simple algorithm to evaluate it are introduced, and closed-form expressions are derived for ﬁrst and secondorder all-pole ﬁlters. The effect of zeros on the effective length is analyzed. An upper bound for the effective length of higherorder ﬁlters is derived using results for low-order ﬁlters, which is illustrated for classical digital lowpass ﬁlters. The use of the measure is demonstrated with examples of implementation of linear-phase {IIR} systems and estimation of transients in variable {IIR} ﬁlters.},

This paper shows how both processes can be nested within the same model and how, when the cycle is buried in noise, the null hypothesis of a deterministic cycle can be tested. The preferred tests are based on the residuals from regressing the observations on sine and cosine functions of the frequency of interest. They are derived as point optimal and locally best invariant tests and can be extended to regression models which include other explanatory variables. The asymptotic distribution of the locally best invariant test, which is a one-sided score test, is shown to be {CrameÂr}±von Mises with two degrees of freedom. Modi®cations for dealing with serially correlated noise are discussed and the methods are illustrated with real data.},

Projections of mean global sea-level ({GSL}) rise provide insuﬃcient information to plan adaptive responses; local decisions require local projections that accommodate different risk tolerances and time frames and that can be linked to storm surge projections. Here we present a global set of local sea-level ({LSL}) projections to inform decisions on timescales ranging from the coming decades through the 22nd century. We provide complete probability distributions, informed by a combination of expert community assessment, expert elicitation, and process modeling. Between the years 2000 and 2100, we project a very likely (90\% probability) {GSL} rise of 0.5–1.2 m under representative concentration pathway ({RCP}) 8.5, 0.4–0.9 m under {RCP} 4.5, and 0.3–0.8 m under {RCP} 2.6. Site-to-site diﬀerences in {LSL} projections are due to varying non-climatic background uplift or subsidence, oceanographic eﬀects, and spatially variable responses of the geoid and the lithosphere to shrinking land ice. The Antarctic ice sheet ({AIS}) constitutes a growing share of variance in {GSL} and {LSL} projections. In the global average and at many locations, it is the dominant source of variance in late 21st century projections, though at some sites oceanographic processes contribute the largest share throughout the century. {LSL} rise dramatically reshapes ﬂood risk, greatly increasing the expected number of “1-in-10” and “1-in-100” year events.},

A quantitative approach based on multiple model assessment metrics was used to evaluate the model's accuracy for each comparison. These comparisons demonstrate that the model accurately predicted water level, tidal flow, and salinity during a 3-year simulation period that spanned a large range of flow and salinity conditions. The model is therefore suitable for detailed investigation of circulation patterns and salinity distributions in the estuary.},

	abstract = {A Ͼ100-day time series of velocity proﬁles, sea level and wind velocity at a strait in the Chilean Inland Sea was analyzed to examine the effects of wind forcing on the mean two-layer exchange. Measurements took place in the Meninea Constriction of the Moraleda Channel during a period dominated by northerly winds. The mean ﬂow in the strait, and in general in the Moraleda Channel, showed net surface northward outﬂow and net bottom southward inﬂow that likely resulted from the dynamical balance between pressure gradient and friction. The inﬂuence of tidal mixing on mean exchange ﬂows was further suggested by isopycnals intersecting the bottom. The same momentum balance between pressure gradient and friction, applied with temporally varying sea level slopes, satisfactorily described the subtidal modiﬁcations to the mean exchange ﬂows produced by wind forcing. The use of sea level slopes to explain the subtidal variability of velocity proﬁles at the Meninea Constriction was justiﬁed by the strong correlation between sea level slopes and wind stresses (0.84). In fact, the vertically integrated dynamics was essentially explained by the balance between wind stress and barotropic pressure gradient for northerly winds. Addition of bottom stress improved the dynamical explanation during periods of weak or southerly winds. This dynamical response was conﬁrmed by the ﬁrst two empirical orthogonal functions of the record. Two-layer exchange ﬂows were weakened by northerly winds as depicted by the ﬁrst empirical function mode, which was unidirectional throughout the water column in response to depth-integrated dynamics. The second empirical function mode was related to the depth-dependent response that followed the wind-induced sea level set-up.},

	abstract = {With the global sea level rising, it is imperative to quantify how the dynamics of tidal estuaries and embayments will respond to increased depth and newly inundated perimeter regions. With increased depth comes a decrease in frictional effects in the basin interior and altered tidal ampliﬁcation. Inundation due to higher sea level also causes an increase in planform area, tidal prism, and frictional effects in the newly inundated areas. To investigate the coupling between ocean forcing, tidal dynamics, and inundation, the authors employ a high-resolution hydrodynamic model of San Francisco Bay, California, comprising two basins with distinct tidal characteristics. Multiple shoreline scenarios are simulated, ranging from a leveed scenario, in which tidal ﬂows are limited to present-day shorelines, to a simulation in which all topography is allowed to ﬂood. Simulating increased mean sea level, while preserving original shorelines, produces additional tidal ampliﬁcation. However, ﬂooding of adjacent low-lying areas introduces frictional, intertidal regions that serve as energy sinks for the incident tidal wave. Net tidal ampliﬁcation in most areas is predicted to be lower in the sea level rise scenarios. Tidal dynamics show a shift to a more progressive wave, dissipative environment with perimeter sloughs becoming major energy sinks. The standing wave southern reach of the bay couples more strongly back to the central portion of the bay, in contrast to the progressive wave northern reach of the bay. Generation of the M4 overtide is also found to vary between scenarios and is a nonnegligible contributor to net changes in high water elevation.},

	abstract = {In partially stratiﬁed shoal–channel estuaries, variations in bathymetry at the shoal–channel interface generate horizontal shears and density gradients, and foam lines characteristic of convergence fronts are frequently observed. This study is based on transect data collected every 30 min across the shoal–channel interface in south San Francisco Bay to analyze the dynamics of the transverse circulation and convergence fronts at this interface throughout a tidal cycle. During the ebb, a lateral density gradient develops as a result of the competition between differential advection of the longitudinal salinity gradient; lateral variations in vertical mixing; and nonlinear advection terms, which are strongest when convergence fronts develop early and late in the ebb. The lateral circulation over the slope is characterized by a large intratidal variability, reversing three times during the ebb. This variability is driven by a balance dominated by inertia and lateral baroclinic pressure gradient during the ebb but also involving Coriolis and advection terms at leading order. The convergence fronts developing at the edge of the shoal during the ebb are greatly affected by the direction of the lateral circulation on the slope and display similar intratidal variability as a result. Observations from moored instruments suggest that these processes are involved in all partially stratiﬁed spring ebbs in south San Francisco Bay and are more sensitive to variations in tidal amplitude than density stratiﬁcation on the slope.},

They include some known methods such as the particle ﬁlter and the ensemble Kalman ﬁlter and some others introduced by the author: the second-order ensemble Kalman ﬁlter and the singular extended interpolated ﬁlter. The aim is to study their behavior in the simple nonlinear chaotic Lorenz system, in the hope of getting some insight into more complex models. It is seen that these ﬁlters perform satisfactory, but the new ﬁlters introduced have the advantage of being less costly. This is achieved through the concept of second-order-exact drawing and the selective error correction, parallel to the tangent space of the attractor of the system (which is of low dimension). Also introduced is the use of a forgetting factor, which could enhance signiﬁcantly the ﬁlter stability in this nonlinear context.},

	abstract = {The recently-proposed nonlinear ensemble transform ﬁlter ({NETF}) is extended to a ﬁxed-lag smoother. The {NETF} approximates Bayes’ theorem by applying a square root update. The smoother ({NETS}) is derived and formulated in a joint framework with the ﬁlter. The new smoother method is evaluated using the low-dimensional, highly nonlinear Lorenz-96 model and a square-box conﬁguration of the {NEMO} ocean model, which is nonlinear and has a higher dimensionality. The new smoother is evaluated within the same assimilation framework against the local error subspace transform Kalman ﬁlter ({LESTKF}) and its smoother extension ({LESTKS}), which are state-of-the-art ensemble squareroot Kalman techniques. In the case of the Lorenz-96 model, both the ﬁlter {NETF} and its smoother extension {NETS} provide lower errors than the {LESTKF} and {LESTKS} for sufﬁciently large ensembles. In addition, the {NETS} shows a distinct dependence on the smoother lag, which results in a stronger error increase beyond the optimal lag of minimum error. For the experiment using {NEMO}, the smoothing in the {NETS} effectively reduces the errors in the state estimates, compared to the ﬁlter. For different state variables very similar optimal smoothing lags are found, which allows for a simultaneous tuning of the lag. In comparison to the {LESTKS}, the smoothing with the {NETS} yields a smaller relative error reduction with respect to the ﬁlter result, and the optimal lag of the {NETS} is shorter in both experiments. This is explained by the distinct update mechanisms of both ﬁlters. The comparison of both experiments shows that the {NETS} can provide better state estimates with similar smoother lags if the model exhibits a sufﬁciently high degree of nonlinearity or if the observations are not restricted to be Gaussian with a linear observation operator.},

Some publications note that the {SEIK} ﬁlter is an ensemble Kalman ﬁlter or even an ensemble square root Kalman ﬁlter. This study examines the relation of the {SEIK} ﬁlter to ensemble square root ﬁlters in detail. It shows that the {SEIK} ﬁlter is indeed an ensemble square root Kalman ﬁlter. Furthermore, a variant of the {SEIK} ﬁlter, the error subspace transform Kalman ﬁlter ({ESTKF}), is presented that results in identical ensemble transformations to those of the ensemble transform Kalman ﬁlter ({ETKF}), while having a slightly lower computational cost. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the performance of three ﬁlters ({SEIK}, {ETKF}, and {ESTKF}) using deterministic and random ensemble transformations. The results show better performance for the {ETKF} and {ESTKF} methods over the {SEIK} ﬁlter as long as this ﬁlter is not applied with a symmetric square root.

They are the well-known ensemble Kalman ﬁlter ({EnKF}), the singular evolutive extended Kalman ({SEEK}) ﬁlter, and the less common singular evolutive interpolated Kalman ({SEIK}) ﬁlter. For comparison, the mathematical formulations of the ﬁlters are reviewed in relation to the extended Kalman ﬁlter as error subspace Kalman ﬁlters. The algorithms are presented in their original form and possible variations are discussed. A comparison of the algorithms shows their theoretical capabilities for efﬁcient data assimilation with large-scale non-linear systems. In particular, problems of the analysis equations are apparent in the original {EnKF} algorithm due to the Monte Carlo sampling of ensembles. Theoretically, the {SEIK} ﬁlter appears to be a numerically very efﬁcient algorithm with high potential for use with non-linear models. The superiority of the {SEIK} ﬁlter is demonstrated on the basis of identical twin experiments using a shallow-water model with non-linear evolution. Identical initial conditions for all three ﬁlters allow for a consistent comparison of the data assimilation results. These show how choices of particular state ensembles and assimilation schemes lead to signiﬁcant variations of the ﬁlter performance. This is related to different qualities of the predicted error subspaces, as is demonstrated in an examination of the predicted state covariance matrices.},

Key changes inﬂuencing the region’s hydrology and hydrodynamics include land use changes, levee construction and channel modiﬁcations, upstream reservoir construction, and out-of-basin water exports. In order to examine how these changes have altered the physical characteristics of the estuary, 3-D hydrodynamic models were constructed to study the system in its “pre-development” condition, prior to signiﬁcant modern anthropogenic inﬂuence, and in its contemporary condition. The pre-development system model was calibrated by varying marsh plain elevations in order to match sparse observations of tidal characteristics; the contemporary system model was calibrated to observed ﬂow, stage, and salinity data. A recent three-year period covering a wide range of ﬂow conditions was used to compare and contrast the hydrodynamic behavior of the two systems. While the contemporary model simulation assumed historical observed boundary conditions, the pre-development model simulation assumed conditions thought to exist prior to the alterations of the past two centuries. The relationship between estuary outﬂow and the longitudinal distance from the estuary mouth to the 2 psu bottom salinity isohaline (X2) was analyzed. Salt intrusion in the pre-development system was found to be slightly more sensitive to outﬂow and responded faster to changes in outﬂow than in the contemporary system. Changes in estuary outﬂows were responsible for more of the salt intrusion diﬀerences between the two systems than were changes in estuary geometry and bathymetry. An analysis of the physical mechanisms contributing to salt intrusion found tidal trapping and other unsteady processes to be more important in the pre-development estuary than in the contemporary one. In both systems, steady processes such as estuarine circulation were strongest during neap tides and unsteady salt intrusion processes were strongest during spring tides, resulting in limited spring-neap variability in salt intrusion.},

The model achieves high skill at hindcasting salinity and residual velocity variation during a 110-day period in 2004 covering a wide range of river discharges and tidal forcing. The approach is based on an existing model framework that has been modified to improve model skill relative to observations. The external forcing has been modified to capture meteorological time-scale variability in salinity, stratification, and residual velocity due to sea level fluctuations at the open boundary and alongestuary wind stress. To reflect changes in vertical mixing due to stratification, the vertical mixing coefficients have been modified to use the bottom boundary layer height rather than the water depth as an effective mixing length scale. The boundary layer parameterization depends on the tidal amplitude and the local baroclinic pressure gradient through the longitudinal Richardson number, and improves the model response to spring–neap variability in tidal amplitude during periods of high river discharge. Finally, steady-state model solutions are evaluated for both the Hudson River and northern San Francisco Bay over a range of forcing conditions. Agreement between the model and scaling of equilibrium salinity intrusions lends confidence that the approach is transferable to other estuaries, despite significant differences in bathymetry. Discrepancies between the model results and observations at high river discharge are indicative of limits at which the formulation begins to fail, and where an alternative approach that captures two-layer dynamics would be more appropriate.},

	abstract = {In order to simulate the biogeochemical function of estuaries across the land-ocean continuum, circulation models must represent a cascade of complex physical processes spanning several spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, governing physical processes tend to vary under different ﬂow regimes, in response to external forcings. Model validation must therefore cover all relevant ﬂow regimes and span suﬃciently long time to represent transient and slowly-varying phenomena. We focus in a multi-year hindcast simulation of the Columbia River estuary – a mesotidal, river-dominated estuary that is also inﬂuenced by coastal upwelling in an Eastern Boundary Current system. Model skill is assessed against long-term observational time series, covering the lower estuary (for salinity) as well as most of the tidal river (for water temperature and elevation). In addition, high-resolution proﬁles of velocity and salinity are used to study salt transport mechanisms at a single station. Results indicate that the model captures the estuarine dynamics of the system, but the skill depends on the ﬂow regime: In general the model performs far better during spring tides (i.e., under partially mixed or time-dependent salt wedge regimes) than under neap tides (i.e., salt wedge and strongly stratiﬁed regimes). While the model accurately represents tidal salt transport mechanisms, it tends to underestimate gravitational transport which becomes more important under neap tide conditions. Furthermore, the skill decreases during high river discharge periods, because the model has diﬃculty capturing the extremely strong stratiﬁcation characteristic to those periods.},

One of these nowcasters is a Bayesian scheme that is used in an extensive ensemble formulation, and the veriﬁcation scheme is uniquely capable of treating both the ensemble members and the mean forecast. The veriﬁcation scheme uses Procrustes shape analysis methods that are well established in statistics but have not, to date, been applied to meteorological forecast assessment. The Procrustes methodology allows for a decomposition of the forecast error into any number of components such as location (displacement), shape, size, orientation and intensity. Each error component can be afforded a separate weighting such that a cost or value of the forecast can be calculated that accounts for different error types. For example, a forecaster who is concerned with the location of a storm would place greater emphasis on correct location in the forecast than other attributes. This ability to apply weights makes the system particularly suited to real-time veriﬁcation applications where conﬁdence in the performance of the forecast translates into improved dissemination to users. In addition, the decomposition of the error into parts enables diagnosis of the error sources that can lead to model adjustment and improvement.},

Hence, the situation becomes comparable with the Discontinuous Galerkin ({DG}) method, but it is simpler to implement than {DG} and has guaranteed L∞ bounds. We focus on the second-order case, but the method can be easily generalized to higher degree polynomials.},

The inﬂuence of variation in the weighting coefﬁcient of the numerical scheme is also investigated. For the latter, the empirical results show no advantage of using values below 1 and suggest the use of a fully implicit scheme (weighting parameter equals 1). The results of varying the reach scale roughnesses shows that many parameter sets can perform equally well (problem of equiﬁnality) even with extreme values. However, this depends on the model region and boundary conditions. The necessity to distinguish between effective parameters and real physical parameters is emphasised. The study demonstrates that this analysis can be used to produce dynamic probability maps of ﬂooding during an event and can be linked to a stopping criterion for {GLUE}.},

Four tidal cycles were sampled along a transect that crossed the bay entrance during cruises in April–May of 1997 and in July of 1997. The April–May cruise coincided with neap tides, while the July cruise occurred during spring tides. The bathymetry of the bay entrance transect featured a broad Chesapeake Channel, 8 km wide and 17 m deep, and a narrow North Channel, 2 km wide and 14 m deep. The two channels were separated by an area with typical depths of 7 m. Linkages among ﬂows, bathymetry, and water density were best established over the North Channel during both cruises. Over this channel, greatest convergence rates alternated from the left (looking into the estuary) slope of the channel during ebb to the right slope during ﬂood as a result of the coupling between bathymetry and tidal ﬂow through bottom friction. These convergences were linked to the strongest transverse shears in the along-estuary tidal ﬂow and to the appearance of salinity fronts, most markedly during ebb periods. In the wide channel, the Chesapeake Channel, frontogenesis mechanisms over the northern slope of the channel were similar to those in the North Channel only in July, when buoyancy was relatively weak and tidal forcing was relatively strong. In April–May, when buoyancy was relatively large and tidal forcing was relatively weak, the recurrence of fronts over the same northern slope of the Chesapeake Channel was independent of the tidal phase. The distinct frontogenesis in the Chesapeake Channel during the increased buoyancy period was attributed to a strong pycnocline that insulated the surface tidal ﬂow from the effects of bottom friction, which tends to decrease the strength of the tidal ﬂow over relatively shallow areas.},

When Qf was moderately high, the tidally averaged length of the estuary L5, here deﬁned as the distance from the mouth to the up-estuary location where the vertically averaged salinity is 5 psu, ﬂuctuated by more than 47 km over the spring–neap cycle, ranging from 28 to .75 km. During low ﬂow periods, L5 varied very little over the spring–neap cycle and approached a steady length. The response is quantiﬁed and compared to predictions of a linearized model derived from the global estuarine salt balance. The model is forced by ﬂuctuations in Qf and {UT} relative to average discharge Qo and tidal amplitude {UTo} and predicts the linear response time scale t and the steady-state length Lo for average forcing. Two vertical mixing schemes are considered, in which 1) mixing is proportional to {UT} and 2) dependence of mixing on stratiﬁcation is also parameterized. Based on least squares ﬁts between L5 and estuary length predicted by the model, estimated t varied by an order of magnitude from a period of high average discharge (Qo 5 750 m3 s21, t 5 4.2 days) to a period of low discharge (Qo 5 170 m3 s21, t 5 40.4 days). Over the range of observed discharge, Lo \} Qo20.3060.03, consistent with the theoretical scaling for an estuary whose landward salt ﬂux is driven by vertical estuarine exchange circulation. Estimated t was proportional to the discharge advection time scale ({LoA}/Qo, where A is the cross-sectional area of the estuary). However, t was 3–4 times larger than the theoretical prediction. The model with stratiﬁcation-dependent mixing predicted variations in L5 with higher skill than the model with mixing proportional to {UT}. This model provides insight into the time-dependent response of a partially stratiﬁed estuary to changes in forcing and explains the strong dependence of the amplitude of the spring–neap response on freshwater discharge. However, the utility of the linear model is limited because it assumes a uniform channel, and because the underlying dynamics are nonlinear, and the forcing Qf and {UT} can undergo large amplitude variations. River discharge, in particular, can vary by over an order of magnitude over time scales comparable to or shorter than the response time scale of the estuary.},

The plant model simulates moving plants in canopies and their dissipative effect on the ambient ﬂow. Concomitantly the plant model is interactively coupled to a 3D hydrodynamic numerical model allowing for a bilateral feedback between moving plants and ﬂow. Model results demonstrate that this interaction causes a modiﬁcation of current proﬁles within and above a canopy as compared to an undisturbed ﬂow. While the overall effect of submerged plant canopies is a dampening of dynamics, the ﬂow may locally be intensiﬁed. The model predicted an intensiﬁcation of the ﬂow near the top of a canopy in concurrence with ﬁeld and laboratory observations. Dissipation in the coupled model, due to the applied non-linear friction law, grows exponentially with increasing ﬂow. As a result the permeability of a canopy to the ambient ﬂow decreases with increasing dissipation. Consequently, at high ﬂow velocities, while becoming increasingly impermeable, a canopy acts like an obstacle that deﬂects the ﬂow above it, which causes the observed intensiﬁcation. Results for canopies consisting of seagrasses with different leaf structure and plant geometry show remarkable differences in predicted plant motions, current proﬁles, drag forces, and velocity shear. Predictions for moving plants are compared with those for rigid, less ﬂexible, structures and undisturbed ﬂow.},

The {BBKS} and the {mBBKS} schemes are shown to be special cases of a more generalized scheme (dubbed {gBBKS}). All operate by automatically slowing the forecaster time-step-averaged reaction rates in order to maintain positivity. The {mBBKS} scheme induces less slowing than the {BBKS} one. With a second modiﬁcation, {gBBKS}-type schemes can become unusual adaptive-time-step schemes. Unfortunately, for the {ODE}-systems that we examined, the adaptive-{mBBKS} variant proves to be substantially less efﬁcient than standard adaptive schemes (in this instance, adaptive time-step second-order explicit Runge–Kutta). Nonetheless, it is possible that the adaptive-{mBBKS}-scheme would become more competitive when the right-hand sides of a system of {ODEs} are more expensive to evaluate.},

We present a comparison of three common global optimization and stochastic approaches to the solution of a magnetotelluric inverse problem for thick layer structures, specifically the controlled random search algorithm, the stochastic sampling by the Monte Carlo method with Markov chains and its newly suggested approximate, but largely accelerated, version, the neighbourhood algorithm. We test the algorithms on a notoriously difficult synthetic 5-layer structure with two conductors situated at different depths, as well as on the experimental {COPROD}1 data set standardly used to benchmark 1D magnetotelluric inversion codes. The controlled random search algorithm is a fast and reliable global minimization procedure if a relatively small number of parameters is involved and a search for a single target minimum is the main objective of the inversion. By repeated runs with different starting test model pools, a sufficiently exhaustive mapping of the parameter space can be accomplished. The Markov chain Monte Carlo gives the most complete information for the parameter estimation and their uncertainty assessment by providing samples from the posterior probability distribution of the model parameters conditioned on the experimental data. Though computationally intensive, this method shows good performance provided the model parameters are sufficiently decorrelated. For layered models with mixed resistivities and layer thicknesses, where strong correlations occur and even different model classes may conform to the target function, the method often converges poorly and even very long chains do not guarantee fair distributions of the model parameters according to their probability densities. The neighbourhood resampling procedure attempts to accelerate the Monte Carlo simulation by approximating the computationally expensive true target function by a simpler, piecewise constant interpolant on a Voronoi mesh constructed over a set of pre-generated models. The method performs relatively fast but seems to suggest systematically larger uncertainties for the model parameters. The results of the stochastic simulations are compared with the standard linearized solutions both for thick layer models and for smooth Occam solutions.},

It has been shown that, under a steplike change of river forcing, the estuarine responses are asymmetric, with the salinity ﬁeld adjusting faster during the rising discharge. The asymmetry arises because the up-estuary salt ﬂux due to exchange ﬂow is a nonlinear function of estuarine length \} L23. During the rising discharge, the estuary is longer, and the salt ﬂux is comparatively less sensitive to the length variations. As a result, the up-estuary salt transport cannot keep pace with the rate of discharge changes, leading to a larger net salt ﬂux and thus a shorter response time. A simple theory accounting for the nonlinear effect is then applied to Hudson-like systems and shown to capture the asymmetric response. The asymmetry is generalizable to other estuarine regimes where upestuary salt ﬂuxes are expressed as nonlinear power laws.},

We examine the former three large-scale variables because they are known to influence North Atlantic tropical cyclone activity and because their underlying drivers are still under investigation. {WLMC} results obtained for these multivariate climate time series suggest that: (1) {MDRSST} and {AMO} show the highest correlation with each other and with respect to the {TC} record over the last millennium, and: (2) {MDRSST} is the dominant climate variable that explains {TC} temporal variability. {WLMC} results confirm that this method is able to capture the most fundamental information contained in multivariate climate time series and is suitable to investigate correlation among climate time series in a multivariate context.},

The unconstrained simulation exhibits considerable skill in replicating the observed interannual variability in vertically integrated heat content estimated from hydrographic data and monthly satellite sea surface temperature and sea surface height data. Globally, the most significant interannual variability modes arise from El Niño–Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean zonal mode, with substantial extension beyond the Tropics into the midlatitudes. In the well-stratified Tropics and subtropics, net annual heat storage variability is driven predominately by the convergence of the advective heat transport, mostly reflecting velocity anomalies times the mean temperature field. Vertical velocity variability is caused by remote wind forcing, and subsurface temperature anomalies are governed mostly by isopycnal displacements (heave). The dynamics at mid- to high latitudes are qualitatively different and vary regionally. Interannual temperature variability is more coherent with depth because of deep winter mixing and variations in western boundary currents and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current that span the upper thermocline. Net annual heat storage variability is forced by a mixture of local air–sea heat fluxes and the convergence of the advective heat transport, the latter resulting from both velocity and temperature anomalies. Also, density-compensated temperature changes on isopycnal surfaces (spice) are quantitatively significant.},

	abstract = {An inverse analysis method using the spectral decomposition of Green’s function is proposed. For linear inverse problems of identifying inner sources from surface responses, Green’s function, relates the sources to the responses. Since this function behaves as a compact operator, it admits the spectral decomposition and is expressed as a sum of distinct eigen values and eigen functions. A suitable inverse operator that maps the responses to the sources is then determined. The proposed method consists of the following three procedures: (1) numerically computing the spectral decomposition and determining the inverse operator; (2) estimating a response function using a set of measured data; and (3) predicting a source function from the response function using inverse operator. A simple inverse analysis method, which uses a pointwise discretization of Green’s function and computes a generalized inverse matrix applying the singularvalue decomposition, is regarded as an approximation to compute the inverse operator. The accuracy, however, is much lower than the proposed method, because of the pointwise discretization and the less accurate computation of the spectral decomposition. Illustrative examples are solved to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed inverse analysis method. Errors due to improper calculation of the inverse operator of Green’s function are shown.},

	abstract = {A two-dimensional (2D) numerical model of wave run-up and overtopping is presented. The model (called {OTT}-2D) is based on the 2D nonlinear shallow water ({NLSW}) equations on a sloping bed, including bed shear stress. These equations are solved using an upwind finite volume technique and a hierarchical Cartesian Adaptive Mesh Refinement ({AMR}) algorithm. The 2D nature of the model means that it can be used to simulate wave transformation, run-up, overtopping and regeneration by obliquely incident and multi-directional waves over alongshore-inhomogeneous sea walls and complex, submerged or surfacepiercing features. The numerical technique used includes accurate shock modeling, and uses no special shoreline-tracking algorithm or shoreline coordinate transformation, which means that noncontiguous flows and multiple shorelines can easily be simulated. The adaptivity of the model ensures that only those parts of the flow that require higher resolution (such as the region of the moving shoreline) receive it, resulting in a model with a high level of efficiency. The model is shown to accurately reproduce analytical and benchmark numerical solutions. Existing wave flume and wave basin datasets are used to test the ability of the model to approximate 1D and 2D wave transformation, run-up and overtopping. Finally, we study a 2D dataset of overtopping of random waves at off-normal incidence to investigate overtopping of a sea wall by long-crested waves. The data set is interesting as it has not been studied in detail before and suggests that, in some instances, overtopping at an angle can lead to more flooding than at normal incidence.},

A simple unified framework is provided which covers a number of straightforward methods and allows for their comparison: 'generalized jackknifing' generates a variety of simple boundary kernel formulae. A well-known method of Rice (1984) is a special case. A popular linear correction method is another: it has close connections with the boundary properties of local linear fitting (Fan and Gijbels, 1992). Links with the 'optimal' boundary kernels of M011er (1991) are investigated. Novel boundary kernels involving kernel derivatives and generalized reflection arise too. In comparisons, various generalized jackknifing methods perform rather similarly, so this, together with its existing popularity, make linear correction as good a method as any. In an as yet unsuccessful attempt to improve on generalized jackknifing, a variety of alternative approaches is considered. A further contribution is to consider generalized jackknife boundary correction for density derivative estimation. En route to all this, a natural analogue of local polynomial regression for density estimation is defined and discussed.},

	abstract = {Most slope limiter functions in high-resolution ﬁnite volume methods to solve hyperbolic conservation laws are designed assuming one-dimensional uniform grids, and they are also used to compute slope limiters in computations on non-uniform rectilinear grids. However, this strategy may lead to either loss of total variation diminishing ({TVD}) stability for 1D linear problems or the loss of formal second-order accuracy if the grid is highly non-uniform. This is especially true when the limiter function is not piecewise linear. Numerical evidences are provided to support this argument for two popular ﬁnite volume strategies: {MUSCL} in space and method of lines in time ({MUSCL}-{MOL}), and capacity-form diﬀerencing. In order to deal with this issue, this paper presents a general approach to study and enhance the slope limiter functions for highly non-uniform grids in the {MUSCL}-{MOL} framework. This approach extends the classical reconstruct-evolve-project procedure to general grids, and it gives suﬃcient conditions for a slope limiter function leading to a {TVD} stable, formal second-order accuracy in space, and symmetry preserving numerical scheme on arbitrary grids. Several widely used limiter functions, including the smooth ones by van Leer and van Albada, are enhanced to satisfy these conditions. These properties are conﬁrmed by solving various one-dimensional and two-dimensional benchmark problems using the enhanced limiters on highly non-uniform rectilinear grids.},

This equation yields changes in L that are asymmetric with respect to ﬂow increases and decreases, showing that the response time of salinity intrusion to ﬂow changes is dependent on L and not directly on ﬂow. An extension of this approach to an estuary for which the area varies exponentially with distance suggests that the simpler prismatic case embodies the essential physics of the response to ﬂow changes. Hindcasts of the response of the salinity ﬁeld in Northern San Francisco Bay to ﬂow pulses based on the simple model are in good agreement with observations, suggesting that dynamical models of the type described here may be more accurate than ones that are purely empirical.},

	abstract = {Surface elevation and current records contain non-tidal variance, often dismissed as noise. The processes responsible for the non-tidal component may also modulate the tidal signal, altering its strength and frequency structure. Because of their manner of generation and propagation, internal tides are inherently irregular. The non-stationary character of these and other tidal processes provides an integral and useful property of tidal records, because it provides an opportunity to obtain insights into tidal dynamics and the interaction of tidal and non-tidal processes. It is, moreover, productive to use multiple approaches in analyzing coastal and estuarine tidal processes so that both the time-varying and average frequency content are determined. Only by confronting the causes of non-stationary behaviour in this way can some of the remaining challenges in tidal analysis and prediction be overcome, e.g. shelf and estuarine currents, river tides, internal tides, tide-surge interactions and tidally inﬂuenced ecological processes. Several examples illustrate the utility of non-stationary tidal analysis methods.},

Analyses of the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of water can be used to estimate evaporative losses from individual pools in such regions in the absence of instrumental data but calculations can be complex, especially in highly variable systems. In this study, we reviewed and combined the most recent equations required for estimation of evaporative losses based on the revised Craig–Gordon model. The updated procedure is presented stepby-step, increasing ease of replication of all calculations. The main constraints and sources of uncertainties in the model were also evaluated. Based on this procedure we have designed a new software, Hydrocalculator, that allows quick and robust estimation of evaporative losses based on isotopic composition of water. The software was validated against measures of ﬁeld pan evaporation under arid conditions in northwest Australia as well as published data from other regions. We found that the major factor contributing to the overall uncertainty in evaporative loss calculations using this method is uncertainty in estimation of the isotope composition of ambient air moisture.},

	abstract = {Linear spectral mixture analysis ({LSMA}) is a widely used technique in remote sensing to estimate abundance fractions of materials present in an image pixel. In order for an {LSMA}-based estimator to produce accurate amounts of material abundance, it generally requires two constraints imposed on the linear mixture model used in {LSMA}, which are the abundance sum-to-one constraint and the abundance nonnegativity constraint. The first constraint requires the sum of the abundance fractions of materials present in an image pixel to be one and the second imposes a constraint that these abundance fractions be nonnegative. While the first constraint is easy to deal with, the second constraint is difficult to implement since it results in a set of inequalities and can only be solved by numerical methods. Consequently, most {LSMA}-based methods are unconstrained and produce solutions that do not necessarily reflect the true abundance fractions of materials. In this case, they can only be used for the purposes of material detection, discrimination, and classification, but not for material quantification. In this paper, we present a fully constrained least squares ({FCLS}) linear spectral mixture analysis method for material quantification. Since no closed form can be derived for this method, an efficient algorithm is developed to yield optimal solutions. In order to further apply the designed algorithm to unknown image scenes, an unsupervised least squares error ({LSE})-based method is also proposed to extend the {FCLS} method in an unsupervised manner. A series of computer simulations and real hyperspectral data experiments were conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed {FCLS} {LSMA} approach in material quantification.},

The high-order moments and integral time scales required for this analysis are evaluated from data obtained at a height of about 5 m above the ocean surface under stability conditions corresponding to z/L = -0.05. Measured moments and probability density functions of some of the individual fluctuations show departures from Gaussianity, but these are sufficiently small to enable good estimates to be obtained using Gaussian instead of measured moments. For the products, the assumption of joint Gaussianity for individual fluctuations provides a reasonable, though somewhat conservative, estimate for the integration times required. The concept of Reynolds number similarity implies that differences in integration time requirements for flows at different Reynolds numbers arise exclusively from differences in integral time scales. A first approximation to the integral time scales relevant to atmospheric flows is presented.},

The paper by Sand-Jensen (2003, Freshwater Biology, 48, 271–283) on drag and reconﬁguration of freshwater macrophytes stimulated comments and a reply about the use of variables in assessments of the drag coefﬁcient (Cd) or the Reynolds number (Re) of such plants. Although the physical argument in this debate starts from the same equations, it diverges into approaches that address differently the dynamic behaviour of ﬂexible plants in the boundary layer ﬂow (the typical condition experienced by lotic macrophytes). 2. We compared three (potentially among many more) such different approaches using some preliminary experiments with Egeria densa by measuring drag (and other physical variables of interest) on (1) a single shoot exposed to varying ﬂume ﬂows; (2) a single shoot exposed to a constant ﬂume ﬂow, from which we subsequently pruned off pieces from the distal end; and (3) multiple shoots exposed to a constant ﬂume ﬂow after they had experienced replicated ﬂow disturbances (causing shoot reconﬁguration). 3. These experiments illustrated that the three approaches can produce opposite trends in the relationship between Cd and Re and that, for a given plant and ﬂow, the Cd values obtained by these approaches can differ by about two orders of magnitude. Thus, conventions about the use of variables are required for experiments on drag and reconﬁguration of freshwater macrophytes, otherwise the ﬁeld will be plagued by a multitude of incomparable results.},

High-quality ﬁeld data of river and coastal ﬂows have been selected and clustered into four particle size classes ͑60–100, 100–200, 200–400, and 400– 600 ␮m͒. The suspended sand transport is found to be strongly dependent on particle size and on current velocity. The suspended sand transport in the coastal zone is found to be strongly dependent on the relative wave height ͑Hs / h͒, particularly for current velocities in the range 0.2– 0.5 m / s. The time-averaged ͑over the wave period͒ advection–diffusion equation is applied to compute the time-averaged sand concentration proﬁle for combined current and wave conditions. Flocculation, hindered settling, and stratiﬁcation effects are included by fairly simple expressions. The bed-shear stress is based on a new bed roughness predictor. The reference concentration function has been recalibrated using laboratory and ﬁeld data for combined steady and oscillatory ﬂow. The computed transport rates show reasonably good agreement ͑within a factor of 2͒ with measured values for velocities in the range of 0.6– 1.8 m / s and sediments in the range of 60– 600 ␮m. The proposed method underpredicts in the low-velocity range ͑Ͻ0.6 m / s͒. A new simpliﬁed transport formula is presented, which can be used to obtain a quick estimate of suspended transport. The modeling of wash load transport in river ﬂow based on the energy concept of Bagnold shows that an extremely large amount of very ﬁne sediment ͑clay and very ﬁne silt͒ can be transported by the ﬂow.},

	abstract = {An analytical model that includes pressure gradient, friction, and the earth’s rotation in both components of the ﬂow is used to study the transverse structure of estuarine exchange ﬂows and the nature of transverse circulation in estuaries of arbitrary bathymetry. Analytical results are obtained for generic bathymetry and also over real depth distributions and are compared with observations. This study extends previous efforts on the topic of transverse structure of density-induced exchange ﬂows in three main aspects: 1) the analytical model explores any arbitrary bathymetry; 2) the results reﬂect transverse asymmetries, relative to a midchannel centerline, associated with the effects of the earth’s rotation; and 3) the transverse circulation produced by the analytical model is examined in detail. Analytical results over generic bathymetry show, in addition to the already reported dependence of exchange ﬂow structure on the Ekman number, two new features. First, the transverse structure of along-estuary ﬂows shows the earth’s rotation effects, even in relatively narrow systems, thus producing transverse asymmetries in these ﬂows. The asymmetries disappear under strongly frictional (high Ekman number) conditions, thus illustrating the previously documented pattern of inﬂow in channels and outﬂows over shoals for typical estuaries. Second, transverse ﬂows resemble a ‘‘sideways gravitational circulation’’ when frictional effects are apparent (Ekman number greater than ϳ0.1) responding to a transverse balance between pressure gradient and friction. These transverse ﬂows reverse direction under very weak friction and reﬂect Coriolis deﬂection of along-estuary ﬂows, that is, geostrophic dynamics. All examples of observed ﬂows are satisfactorily explained by the dynamics included in the analytical model.},

Simpliﬁed bed-load transport formulas are presented, which can be used to obtain a quick estimate of bed-load transport in river and coastal ﬂows. It is shown that the sediment transport of ﬁne silts to coarse sand can be described in a uniﬁed model framework using fairly simple expressions. The proposed model is fully predictive in the sense that only the basic hydrodynamic parameters ͑depth, current velocity, wave height, wave period, etc.͒ and the basic sediment characteristics ͑d10, d50, d90, water temperature, and salinity͒ need to be known. The prediction of the effective bed roughness is an integral part of the model.},

	abstract = {The Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev method is an s-stage Runge-Kutta method designed for the explicit integration of stiff systems of ordinary differential equations originating from spatial discretization of parabolic partial differential equations (method of lines). The method possesses an extended real stability interval with a length fl proportional to sz. The method can be applied with s arbitrarily large, which is an attractive feature due to the proportionality of fl with s2. The involved stability property here is internal stability. Internal stability has to do with the propagation of errors over the stages within one single integration step. This internal stability property plays an important role in our examination of full convergence properties of a class of 1st and 2nd order schemes. Full convergence means convergence of the fully discrete solution to the solution of the partial differential equation upon simultaneous space-time grid refinement. For a model class of linear problems we prove convergence under the sole condition that the necessary time-step restriction for stability is satisfied. These error bounds are valid for any s and independent of the stiffness of the problem. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results.},

	abstract = {Bathymetric measurements show that a deep, subtidal channel in San Pablo Bay, California, has consistently narrowed during the past 150 years. This raises general questions on the seasonal and intertidal morphodynamic processes acting at the subtidal channel-shoal interface. The current work addresses these questions using a process-based morphodynamic model (Delft3D). Model results reveal considerable morphodynamic activity during a tidal cycle. Deposition on the channel margin is largest during ﬂooding of the shoals. Erosion rates (mainly occuring during ebb) remain relatively small, so that net accretion occurs on much of the channel margin. A remarkable ﬁnding is that locally generated wind waves are responsible for shoal extension and depositional channel narrowing. High suspended sediment concentration ({SSC}) in the channel is a critical factor. Apart from sediment supply during high river ﬂow, wind waves suspending sediment on the shoals cause high {SSC} levels in the channel at ebb. Sensitivity analysis shows that wind direction even determines the location of channel margin accretion. Fluvial sediment supply is another cause of high {SSC} in the channel. Density currents, 3-D circulation ﬂows, sea level rise, or varied sediment characteristics only have a limited effect on the erosion and sedimentation patterns. A 30 year forecast shows that deeper shoals and decreasing ﬂuvial sediment supply lower {SSC} levels in the channel, limit channel margin accretion, and even lead to net channel margin erosion in some areas. Channel shape thus remains subject to dynamic processes related to local variations in sediment supply, albeit to a more limited extent than in earlier decades.},

	abstract = {Future changes in hydrologic patterns and sea level rise will impact water levels in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta), the hub of California’s water supply system and an important ecosystem and agricultural area. An important tool for flood management is stagefrequency curves which indicate how often certain water levels (or stage) occur. The Delta poses inherent complexity in the determination of stage-frequency and requires a number of considerations. One needs to account for river flows coming into the Delta, as well as the effect of tides from the Delta’s connection to the ocean through San Francisco Bay. During storms, Delta water levels are also affected by storm surge from the advancing storm fronts coming from the Pacific Ocean. Under climate change, Delta water levels will also be affected by rising sea levels and expected changes in hydrology, such as shifts in timing and amount of precipitation and runoff and changes in how much of our precipitation falls as rain or snow (referred to as climate change hydrology in this paper). With these taken into consideration, this study lays out the assumption and method used to develop stage-frequency curves in the Delta for three different conditions: current hydrology conditions, current hydrology with sea level rise, and late-century climate change hydrology with sea level rise. In addition, water surface elevation profiles along the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers for various magnitudes of flood events were compared to the top of levee elevations. Both the stage-frequency curves and the water surface elevation profiles comparisons to top of levee elevations provide valuable information to water resources planners and were applied to inform life and flood risk analysis for the Delta in the Central Valley Flood Protection Plan 2017 Update.},

	abstract = {This study reviews recent research on estuarine characteristics responsible for distortion of the barotropic tide in shallow well-mixed estuaries. In addition, a particular class of flood-dominant estuary is described in which estuarine channels shoal over short distances to depths less than the offshore tidal amplitude. Tidal distortion in general results from the nonlinear interaction of the offshore tide with the estuary, and is reflected in the growth of harmonics and compound tides of the principle astronomical constituents. In this study, the amplitude ratio and relative phase of and M2 are used to indicate the magnitude and sense of the tidal asymmetry within the estuary. Tidal distortion in the specific class of flood-dominant estuaries investigated here in detail can be identified by low M2 to M4 relative phases ({\textasciitilde} 5° to 35°) and high M4/M2 ratios ({\textasciitilde} 0.3 to 0.4) over distances of a few kilometers. These systems (common along the New England ({USA}) coast and elsewhere) appear to result from a combination of small physical scale and large offshore tidal amplitude relative to distal channel depths. Shoaling channels effectively truncate the lowest portion of the tide, resulting in an extended falling tide and a slow shallow ebb flow. These systems are analogous to tides propagating up rivers, but important distinctions exist This study investigates tidal distortion in detail at six such systems, using multiple tide records within individual systems, variations in offshore tidal forcing, and numerical modeling.},

	abstract = {The generation of residual circulation in a tidally energetic estuary with constant longitudinal salinity gradient and parabolic cross section is examined by means of a two-dimensional cross-sectional numerical model, neglecting river runoff and Stokes drift. It is shown how the longitudinal and lateral residual circulation can be decomposed into contributions from various processes such as tidal straining circulation, gravitational circulation, advectively driven circulation, and horizontal mixing circulation. The sensitivity of the residual circulation and its components from various processes to changes in forcing is investigated by varying the Simpson number (nondimensional longitudinal buoyancy gradient) and the unsteadiness parameter (nondimensional tidal frequency), as well as the bed roughness and the width of the estuary. For relatively weak salinity gradient forcing, the tidal straining circulation dominates the residual exchange circulation in support of classical estuarine circulation (up-estuary ﬂow near the bed and down-estuary ﬂow near the surface). The strength of the longitudinal estuarine circulation clearly increases with increased salinity gradient forcing. However, when the Simpson number exceeds 0.15, the relative contributions of both gravitational circulation and advectively driven circulation to estuarine circulation increase substantially. Lateral residual circulation is relatively weak for small Simpson numbers and becomes ﬂood oriented (divergent ﬂow near the bed and convergent ﬂow near the surface) for larger Simpson numbers because of increasing contributions from gravitational and advectively driven circulation. Increasing the unsteadiness number leads to decreased longitudinal and lateral residual circulation. Although changes in bed roughness result in relatively small changes in residual circulation, results are sensitive to the width of the estuary, mainly because of changes in residual exchange circulation driven by tidal straining.},

            Interannual and climatological variations of wind stress drag coefficient ({CD}) are examined over the global ocean from 1998 to 2004. Here {CD} is calculated using high temporal resolution (3- and 6-hourly) surface atmospheric variables from two datasets: 1) the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ({ECMWF}) Re-Analysis ({ERA}-40) and 2) the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System ({NOGAPS}). The stability-dependent {CD} algorithm applied to both datasets gives almost identical values over most of the global ocean, confirming the validity of results. Overall, major findings of this paper are as follows: 1) the {CD} value can change significantly (e.g., \&gt;50\%) on 12-hourly time scales around the Kuroshio and Gulf Stream current systems; 2) there is strong seasonal variability in {CD}, but there is not much interannual change in the spatial variability for a given month; 3) a global mean {CD} ≈ 1.25 × 10−3 is found in all months, while {CD} ≥ 1.5 × 10−3 is prevalent over the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans and in southern high-latitude regions as well, and {CD} ≤ 1.0 × 10−3 is typical in the eastern equatorial Pacific cold tongue; and 4) including the effects of air–sea stability on {CD} generally causes an increase of \&gt;20\% in comparison to the one calculated based on neutral conditions in the tropical regions. Finally, spatially and temporally varying {CD} fields are therefore needed for a variety of climate and air–sea interaction studies.},

	abstract = {In many dryland rivers with intermittent ﬂow, relatively deep segments of the river channel serve as refugia for aquatic life during protracted intervals between ﬂows. Semipermanent channel segments are known as waterholes in the semiarid Cooper Creek system of western Queensland. Fractional water loss by evaporation was estimated in 15 Cooper waterholes from the increase in conservative ion (Naϩ and {ClϪ}) concentrations and independently from evaporative fractionation of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in water. The major solute chemistry and isotope results indicated that evaporative water loss controlled the water levels between ﬂows and that the surface waters were effectively isolated from underlying groundwater that had a distinctive chemical and isotopic composition. Fractional water loss rates combined with stage–volume relationships for each basin showed a mean evaporative loss rate of 2.1 m {yrϪ}1; during that time (April–October 2002), pan evaporation averaged 2.5 m {yrϪ}1. Site-speciﬁc extrapolation of those estimated evaporative loss rates indicated that the waterholes would dry to 10\% of their bankfull volumes in 6–23 months, although those estimates were based on sampling in 2002, when pan evaporation rates were 18\% higher than the long-term mean. These persistence times show the importance of occasional, irregular ﬂow pulses in sustaining these aquatic refugia; the desiccation of waterholes could become more common if future water withdrawals reduce the frequency and intensity of river ﬂows to the point where they occur less often than annually.},

In a second phase, the Jensen–Shannon divergence is adopted for measuring dissimilarities between data collected at several stations. The signals are compared in the frequency and time–frequency domains, and the {HC} is applied to visualize hidden relationships.

	abstract = {One of the most challenging areas in tidal analysis is the study of nonstationary signals with a tidal component, as they confront both current analysis methods and dynamical understanding. A new analysis tool has been developed, {NS}\_TIDE, adapted to the study of nonstationary signals, in this case, river tides. It builds the nonstationary forcing directly into the tidal basis functions. It is implemented by modiﬁcation of T\_TIDE; however, certain concepts, particularly the meaning of a constituent and the Rayleigh criterion, are redeﬁned to account for the smearing effects on the tidal spectral lines by nontidal energy. An error estimation procedure is included that constructs a covariance matrix of the regression coefﬁcients, based on either an uncorrelated or a correlated noise model. The output of {NS}\_TIDE consists of time series of subtidal water levels [mean water level ({MWL})] and tidal properties (amplitudes and phases), expressed in terms of external forcing functions. The method was tested using records from a station on the Columbia River, 172 km from the ocean entrance, where the tides are strongly altered by river ﬂow. {NS}\_TIDE hindcast explains 96.4\% of the signal variance with a root-mean-square error of 0.165 m obtained from 288 parameters, far better than traditional harmonic analysis (38.5\%, 0.604 m, and 127 parameters). While keeping the beneﬁts of harmonic analysis, its advantages compared to existing tidal analysis methods include its capacity to distinguish frequencies within tidal bands without losing resolution in the time domain or data at the endpoints of the time series.},

In this paper, we propose a novel and adaptive Fourier decomposition method ({FDM}), based on the Fourier theory, and demonstrate its efficacy for the analysis of nonlinear and non-stationary time series. The proposed {FDM} decomposes any data into a small number of ‘Fourier intrinsic band functions’ ({FIBFs}). The {FDM} presents a generalized Fourier expansion with variable amplitudes and variable frequencies of a time series by the Fourier method itself. We propose an idea of zero-phase filter bank-based multivariate {FDM} ({MFDM}), for the analysis of multivariate nonlinear and non-stationary time series, using the {FDM}. We also present an algorithm to obtain cut-off frequencies for {MFDM}. The proposed {MFDM} generates a finite number of band-limited multivariate {FIBFs} ({MFIBFs}). The {MFDM} preserves some intrinsic physical properties of the multivariate data, such as scale alignment, trend and instantaneous frequency. The proposed methods provide a time–frequency–energy ({TFE}) distribution that reveals the intrinsic structure of a data. Numerical computations and simulations have been carried out and comparison is made with the empirical mode decomposition algorithms.},

	abstract = {Analysis of uncertainty is often neglected in the evaluation of complex systems models, such as computational models used in hydrology or ecology. Prediction uncertainty arises from a variety of sources, such as input error, calibration accuracy, parameter sensitivity and parameter uncertainty. In this study, various computational approaches were investigated for analysing the impact of parameter uncertainty on predictions of streamﬂow for a water-balance hydrological model used in eastern Australia. The parameters and associated equations which had greatest impact on model output were determined by combining differential error analysis and Monte Carlo simulation with stochastic and deterministic sensitivity analysis. This integrated approach aids in the identiﬁcation of insigniﬁcant or redundant parameters and provides support for further simpliﬁcations in the mathematical structure underlying the model. Parameter uncertainty was represented by a probability distribution and simulation experiments revealed that the shape (skewness) of the distribution had a signiﬁcant effect on model output uncertainty. More speciﬁcally, increasing negative skewness of the parameter distribution correlated with decreasing width of the model output conﬁdence interval (i.e. resulting in less uncertainty). For skewed distributions, characterisation of uncertainty is more accurate using the conﬁdence interval from the cumulative distribution rather than using variance. The analytic approach also identiﬁed the key parameters and the non-linear ﬂux equation most inﬂuential in affecting model output uncertainty.},

However, methods that consider the entire Probability Density Function ({PDF}) of the model output, rather than its variance only, are preferable in cases where variance is not an adequate proxy of uncertainty, e.g. when the output distribution is highly-skewed or when it is multi-modal. Still, the adoption of density-based methods has been limited so far, possibly because they are relatively more difﬁcult to implement. Here we present a novel {GSA} method, called {PAWN}, to efﬁciently compute density-based sensitivity indices. The key idea is to characterise output distributions by their Cumulative Distribution Functions ({CDF}), which are easier to derive than {PDFs}.

However, this method can be laborious and it raises other concerns such as which spatial model to use or how to compare different spatial models. To improve the accuracy of variable selection in ecology, this study evaluates an alternative method based on a spatial cross-validation procedure. Such a procedure is usually used for model evaluation but can also provide interesting outcomes for variable selection in the presence of spatial autocorrelation.},

Management of regulated rivers can include development of environmental flows that seek to restore ecological integrity. However, designing a flow regime that adequately supports aquatic biodiversity requires quantifiable metrics of hydrologic variability that directly relate to aquatic species diversity. 
 
This study examined both regulated and unregulated montane rivers over 3 years within the marked seasonality of California's Mediterranean climate to determine which quantifiable elements of a flow regime were most correlated with changes in the biologic community, using stream invertebrates during the summer low flow period as an indicator. 
 
Boosted regression trees were used to assess relationships between quantifiable metrics of flow regimes and the invertebrate community. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and a multi-response permutation procedure were used to analyze general trends in invertebrate assemblage patterns between rivers and years. Results indicated that hydrologic alteration corresponded to differences in invertebrate community composition, and that metrics related to the spring snowmelt recession and variability in summer water temperature had the greatest relative influence on invertebrate community diversity. 
 
Rivers exhibiting longer duration spring recessions, lower daily rates of change during the spring recession, and stable water temperatures during summer supported relatively higher invertebrate community diversity. These relationships suggest that quantifiable metrics associated with seasonal flow variability and predictability should be an integral part of environmental flow design and monitoring.},

	title = {Modelling hyporheic exchange: From the boundary layer to the basin},
	abstract = {Hydrological connections in streams occur longitudinally along the stream channel, laterally with the floodplain and vertically with the hyporheic zone. These connections are an important control on freshwater ecosystem processes at the basin-scale including nutrient cycling and retention; movements of organisms to complete life stages; and the provision of refugia during high and low flow periods. They also influence human and farm health by creating pathways for the sequestration and mobilization of microbial communities including human and animal pathogens. Methods are available to observe and model lateral and longitudinal hydrological connectivity at the basin-scale but this is not true for the vertical dimension. Understanding the strength of vertical hydrological connectivity across river basins is important for freshwater science and will lead to better catchment management for human and ecosystem health outcomes. Hyporheic exchange is fundamental to vertical connectivity, transporting mass, energy, and momentum between the sediment and the water column. Recent work by the authors has led to the development of new resistance model of sediment-water interfacial flux at the patch scale (ca., 1 to 10 m) including processes of hyporheic exchange. The model parameterizes patch-scale hyporheic exchange in terms of a mass transfer resistance coefficient R, and a scaling law for R has been developed based on a meta-analysis of previously published hyporheic exchange experiments in recirculating laboratory flumes. For this study, we adapt this scaling law to natural stream channels in the Murray-Darling Basin using reach-averaged values of key hydraulic variables that are assumed to be fixed throughout the stream network or modeled using hydraulic geometry relations. Our model of patch-scale hyporheic exchange predicts much more frequent exchange between the water column and the streambed in steeper upland streams. A molecule of water transported along a 100 km length of upland stream may journey into the streambed more than 1000 times. In contrast, the same molecule might only pass into the streambed once while being transported a similar distance in a lowland river. This suggests that any hyporheic processes influencing the character of the water column (through biogeochemical transformations or source-sink dynamics) will have a much stronger effect in steeper gradient rivers. The stronger hydrological connectivity between water column and hyporheic zone in steeper rivers is likely to promote buffering of solute and suspended contaminants delivered as a pulse from headwater catchments. This suggests an interesting interaction between vertical and longitudinal hydrological and biogeochemical connectivity at the basin-scale. Upland rivers may be characterized by strong vertical and weak longitudinal connectivity whereas the reverse may be true in lowland rivers.},

The Cosumnes River Preserve is a multi-partner effort to protect and restore natural habitats within the floodplain of the Cosumnes River. This landscape-scale project protects over 40,000 acres of riparian forest, wetlands, and vernal pool grasslands. Early restoration efforts relied on active measures, such as hand planting of oaks and willows. This method, however, was expensive and labor intensive, and sometimes plantings failed. In the last several years we have focused on restoring natural processes that sustain and create habitat, such as flooding. Natural process restoration is now an integral part of the restoration program and central to our planning for property acquisition. Intentional levee breaches have restored the hydrologic connection between the lower Cosumnes River and its floodplain. Floods passing through levee breaches created in 1995 and 1997 have deposited sediment, seeds and plant cuttings on former farm fields, and stimulated natural recruitment of cottonwood and willow riparian forests. This method also provided valuable habitat for chinook salmon and Sacramento splittail. Creating seasonally flooded habitat rather than permanent ponds benefits native fishes more than non-native fishes. Monitoring by the Cosumnes Research Group and others is providing feedback for adaptive management},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Wetlands are species-rich habitats performing valuable ecosystem services such as flood protection, water quality enhancement, food chain support and carbon sequestration. Worldwide, wetlands have been drained to convert them into agricultural land or industrial and urban areas. A realistic estimate is that 50 \% of the world's wetlands have been lost.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}{nSCOPE}: This paper reviews the relationship between wetlands and agriculture with the aim to identify the successes and failures of agricultural use in different types of wetlands, with reference to short-term and long-term benefits and issues of sustainability. It also addresses a number of recent developments which will lead to pressure to reclaim and destroy natural wetlands, i.e. the continuous need for higher production to feed an increasing world population and the increasing cultivation of energy crops. Finally, attention is paid to the development of more flood-tolerant crop cultivars.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}{nCONCLUSIONS}: Agriculture has been carried out in several types of (former) wetlands for millennia, with crop fields on river floodplain soils and rice fields as major examples. However, intensive agricultural use of drained/reclaimed peatlands has been shown to lead to major problems because of the oxidation and subsidence of the peat soil. This does not only lead to severe carbon dioxide emissions, but also results in low-lying land which needs to be protected against flooding. Developments in South-East Asia, where vast areas of tropical peatlands are being converted into oil palm plantations, are of great concern in this respect. Although more flood-tolerant cultivars of commercial crop species are being developed, these are certainly not suitable for cultivation in wetlands with prolonged flooding periods, but rather will survive relatively short periods of waterlogging in normally improved agricultural soils. From a sustainability perspective, reclamation of peatlands for agriculture should be strongly discouraged. The opportunities for agriculture in naturally functioning floodplains should be further investigated. The development and use of crop cultivars with an even stronger flood tolerance could form part of the sustainable use of such floodplain systems. Extensive use of wetlands without drastic reclamation measures and without fertilizer and pesticides might result in combinations of food production with other wetland services, with biodiversity remaining more or less intact. There is a need for research by agronomists and environmental scientists to optimize such solutions.},

Juvenile salmon leave their natal rivers at different sizes, ages and times of the year, and it is thought that this life history variation contributes to their population sustainability, and is thus central to many recovery efforts. However, in order to preserve and restore diversity in life history traits, it is necessary to first understand how environmental factors affect their expression and success. We used otolith $^{\textrm{87}}$Sr/$^{\textrm{86}}$Sr in adult Chinook salmon ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Oncorhynchus tshawytcha{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}) returning to the Stanislaus River in the California Central Valley ({USA}) to reconstruct the sizes at which they outmigrated as juveniles in a wetter (2000) and drier (2003) year. We compared rotary screw trap-derived estimates of outmigrant timing, abundance and size with those reconstructed in the adults from the same cohort. This allowed us to estimate the relative survival and contribution of migratory phenotypes (fry, parr, smolts) to the adult spawning population under different flow regimes. Juvenile abundance and outmigration behavior varied with hydroclimatic regime, while downstream survival appeared to be driven by size- and time-selective mortality. Although fry survival is generally assumed to be negligible in this system, \&gt;20\% of the adult spawners from outmigration year 2000 had outmigrated as fry. In both years, all three phenotypes contributed to the spawning population, however their relative proportions differed, reflecting greater fry contributions in the wetter year (23\% vs. 10\%) and greater smolt contributions in the drier year (13\% vs. 44\%). These data demonstrate that the expression and success of migratory phenotypes vary with hydrologic regime, emphasizing the importance of maintaining diversity in a changing climate.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Samples of fine-grained channel bed sediment and overbank floodplain deposits were collected along the main channels of the Rivers Aire (and its main tributary, the River Calder) and Swale, in Yorkshire, {UK}, in order to investigate downstream changes in the storage and deposition of heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn), total P and the sum of selected {PCB} congeners, and to estimate the total storage of these contaminants within the main channels and floodplains of these river systems. Downstream trends in the contaminant content of the {\textless}63 μm fraction of channel bed and floodplain sediment in the study rivers are controlled mainly by the location of the main sources of the contaminants, which varies between rivers. In the Rivers Aire and Calder, the contaminant content of the {\textless}63 μm fraction of channel bed and floodplain sediment generally increases in a downstream direction, reflecting the location of the main urban and industrialized areas in the middle and lower parts of the basin. In the River Swale, the concentrations of most of the contaminants examined are approximately constant along the length of the river, due to the relatively unpolluted nature of this river. However, the Pb and Zn content of fine channel bed sediment decreases downstream, due to the location of historic metal mines in the headwaters of this river, and the effect of downstream dilution with uncontaminated sediment. The magnitude and spatial variation of contaminant storage and deposition on channel beds and floodplains are also controlled by the amount of {\textless}63 μm sediment stored on the channel bed and deposited on the floodplain during overbank events. Consequently, contaminant deposition and storage are strongly influenced by the surface area of the floodplain and channel bed. Contaminant storage on the channel beds of the study rivers is, therefore, generally greatest in the middle and lower reaches of the rivers, since channel width increases downstream. Comparisons of the estimates of total storage of specific contaminants on the channel beds of the main channel systems of the study rivers with the annual contaminant flux at the catchment outlets indicate that channel storage represents {\textless}3\% of the outlet flux and is, therefore, of limited importance in regulating that flux. Similar comparisons between the annual deposition flux of specific contaminants to the floodplains of the study rivers and the annual contaminant flux at the catchment outlet, emphasise the potential importance of floodplain deposition as a conveyance loss. In the case of the River Aire the floodplain deposition flux is equivalent to between ca. 2\% ({PCBs}) and 36\% (Pb) of the outlet flux. With the exception of {PCBs}, for which the value is ≅0, the equivalent values for the River Swale range between 18\% (P) and 95\% (Pb). The study emphasises that knowledge of the fine-grained sediment delivery system operating in a river basin is an essential prerequisite for understanding the transport and storage of sediment-associated contaminants in river systems and that conveyance losses associated with floodplain deposition exert an important control on downstream contaminant fluxes and the fate of such contaminants. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This research identifies a flood regime typology and approach for flood regime characterization, using unsupervised cluster analysis of flood events defined by ecologically meaningful metrics, including magnitude, timing, duration, and rate of change as applied to the unregulated lowland alluvial Cosumnes River of California, United States. Flood events, isolated from the 107-year daily flow record, account for approximately two-thirds of the annual flow volume. Our analysis suggests six flood types best capture the range of flood event variability. Two types are distinguished primarily by high peak flows, another by later season timing and long duration, two by small magnitudes separated by timing, and the last by later peak flow within the flood event. The flood regime was also evaluated through inter- and intra-annual frequency of the identified flood types, their relationship to water year conditions, and their long-term trends. This revealed, for example, year-to-year variability in flood types, associations between wet years and high peak magnitude types and between dry years and the low magnitude, late season flood type, and increasing and decreasing contribution to total annual flow in the highest two peak magnitude classes, respectively. This research focuses needed attention on floodplains, flood hydrology, ecological implications, and the utility of extending flow regime classification typically used for environmental flow targets. The approach is broadly applicable and extensible to other systems, where findings can be used to understand physical processes, assess change, and improve management strategies.},

This includes the importance of fine sediment in the transport of nutrients and contaminants, including phosphorus (P). Sediment source exerts a key control on the physical and geochemical properties of suspended sediment, including its P content, and will also influence the potential for implementing effective sediment and diffuse source pollution control strategies. Information on suspended sediment source, defined in terms of both source type and spatial origin, is therefore increasingly needed. Such information is difficult to obtain using traditional monitoring techniques, but source tracing or fingerprinting techniques afford a valuable and effective alternative approach to establish the relative importance of potential sediment sources.

	abstract = {The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta has been transformed from the largest wetland system on the Pacific Coast of the United States to highly productive farmland and other uses embodying California’s water struggles. The Delta comprises the upper extent of the San Francisco Estuary and connects two-thirds of California via the watersheds that feed into it. It is central to the larger California landscape and associated ecosystems, which will continue to experience substantial modification in the future due to climate change and continued land and water use changes. Yet this vital ecological and economic link for California and the world has been altered to the extent that it is no longer able to support needed ecological functions. Approximately 3\% of the Delta’s historical tidal wetland extent remains wetland today; the Delta is now crisscrossed with agricultural ditches replacing the over 1,000 miles of branching tidal channels. Imagining a healthy Delta ecosystem in the future and taking bold, concrete steps toward that future requires an understanding and vision of what a healthy ecosystem looks like. For a place as extensive, unique, and modified as the Delta, valuable knowledge can be acquired through the study of the past, investigating the Delta as it existed just prior to the substantial human modifications of the last 160 years. Though the Delta is irrevocably altered, this does not mean that the past is irrelevant. Underlying geologic and hydrologic processes still influence the landscape, and native species still ply the waters, soar through the air, and move across the land. Significant opportunities are available to strategically reconnect landscape components in ways that support ecosystem resilience to both present and future stressors.},

While the added precision of geo-spatial interpolation to field scouting generates improved zone maps and are an improvement over field-wide applications, it is limited in detail due to expense, and lacks the high precision required for pixel level applications. Multi-spectral imagery gives the spatial detail required, but broad band indexes are not sensitive to many variables in the crop and soil environment. Hyperspectral imagery provides both the spatial detail of airborne imagery and spectral resolution for spectroscopic and narrow band analysis techniques developed over recent decades in the laboratory that will advance precise determination of water and bio-physical properties of crops and soils. For several years, we have conducted remote sensing investigations to improve cotton production through field spectrometer measurements, and plant and soil samples in commercial fields and crop trials. We have developed spectral analyses techniques for plant and soil conditions through determination of crop water status, effectiveness of pre-harvest defoliant applications, and soil characterizations.

	abstract = {{AbstractMaximum} water temperatures in streams throughout the western {USA} typically occur in late summer and early autumn, coinciding with low stream flow. However, in the spring-fed Big Springs Creek in northern California, where constant-temperature groundwater springs provide relatively stable stream flow throughout the year, peak water temperatures and maximum diurnal variability occur in spring. We attribute this anomaly to the riverine canopy provided by emergent aquatic macrophytes (e.g., Polygonum hydropiperoides and Nasturtium officinale), which mimics the shade function of a riparian canopy. Macrophyte biomass increased 264\% between January and August 2011. This increase coincided with a 111\% reduction in flow velocity and a 53\% increase in stream depth. Solar radiation was reduced by an average of 88\% in patches of macrophytes that covered {\textasciitilde}50\% of the water surface during the summer. Decreased solar radiation reduced rates of stream heating, maximum temperatures, and temperature variability. We tested the riverine canopy hypothesis analytically based on a 2-dimensional hydrodynamic and water-temperature model. The model predicted that emergent aquatic macrophytes reduce maximum water temperatures by an average of 5.1°C (p {\textless} 0.001) during late summer, when water temperatures in northern California streams typically increase. Our study shows the influence of a riverine canopy on naturally occurring temporal patterns of water temperature in a spring-fed stream. Our results could inform basin-scale management or regulatory strategies to address water-temperature conditions.},

This study investigated the effects of hydrologic connectivity to stream water on soil nutrient fluxes in plots (n = 20) located among four created and two natural freshwater wetlands of varying hydrology in the Piedmont physiographic province of Virginia. Surface water was slightly deeper; hydrologic inputs of sediment, sediment-N, and ammonium were greater; and soil net ammonification, N mineralization, and N turnover were greater in plots with stream water classified as their primary water source compared with plots with precipitation or groundwater as their primary water source. Soil water-filled pore space, inputs of nitrate, and soil net nitrification, P mineralization, and denitrification enzyme activity ({DEA}) were similar among plots. Soil ammonification, N mineralization, and N turnover rates increased with the loading rate of ammonium to the soil surface. Phosphorus mineralization and ammonification also increased with sedimentation and sediment-N loading rate. Nitrification flux and {DEA} were positively associated in these wetlands. In conclusion, hydrologic connectivity to stream water increased allochthonous inputs that stimulated soil N and P cycling and that likely led to greater retention of sediment and nutrients in created and natural wetlands. Our findings suggest that wetland creation and restoration projects should be designed to allow connectivity with stream water if the goal is to optimize the function of water quality improvement in a watershed.},

Vegetation has a strong channelization effect on the flow, increasing the difference between mid-channel and bank velocities. It also diverted flow away from densely vegetated areas. On the floodplain, vegetation stands caused high velocity preferential flow paths that were otherwise unaccounted for in the unvegetated model runs.

Chlorophyll a (Ch1 a) distribution across a 0.36 km(2) restored floodplain (Cosumnes River, California) was analysed throughout the winter and spring flood season from January to June 2005. In addition, high temporal-resolution Ch1 a measurements were made in situ with field fluorometers in the floodplain and adjacent channel. 2. The primary objectives were to characterise suspended algal biomass distribution across the floodplain at various degrees of connection with the channel and to correlate Ch1 a concentration and distribution with physical and chemical gradients across the floodplain. 3. Our analysis indicates that periodic connection and disconnection of the floodplain with the channel is vital to the functioning of the floodplain as a source of concentrated suspended algal biomass for downstream aquatic ecosystems. 4. Peak Ch1 a levels on the floodplain occurred during disconnection, reaching levels as high as 25 mu g L-1. Ch1 a distribution across the floodplain was controlled by residence time and local physical/biological conditions, the latter of which were primarily a function of water depth. 5. During connection, the primary pond on the floodplain exhibited low Ch1 a (mean = 3.4 mu g L-1) and the shallow littoral zones had elevated concentrations (mean = 4.6 mu g L-1); during disconnection, shallow zone Ch1 a increased (mean = 12.4 mu g L-1), but the pond experienced the greatest algal growth (mean = 14.7 mu g L-1). 6. Storm-induced floodwaters entering the floodplain not only displaced antecedent floodplain waters, but also redistributed floodplain resources, creating complex mixing dynamics between parcels of water with distinct chemistries. Incomplete replacement of antecedent floodplain waters led to localised hypoxia in non-flushed areas. 7. The degree of complexity revealed in this analysis makes clear the need for high-resolution spatial and temporal studies such as this to begin to understand the functioning of dynamic and heterogeneous floodplain ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Resonance characteristics of tidal waves in a network are investigated with the linearized, one-dimensional shallow water equations. The network comprises a semi-enclosed main channel with an adjacent secondary channel at an arbitrary position. Water motion is forced by a prescribed incoming wave at the entrance of the main channel. The model is used to compute the ratio of sea surface height amplitude in the presence and absence of the secondary channel. Relevance lies in the possible construction of secondary channels to reduce tidal range in the main channel. When μ = 2πl*{\textbackslash}nb/l *{\textbackslash}nt ≳ (l*{\textbackslash}nb being the length of the main channel, l*{\textbackslash}nt the tidal wavelength) and friction is weak, it is found that reduction (amplification) of the tidal range occurs for secondary channels located less (more) than a quarter wavelength from the closed end of the main channel. Furthermore, a minimum is observed halfway between the closed end and the nodal point, and a maximum a quarter wavelength further seaward. With increasing friction and/or decreasing length of the main channel, amplitude ratios become less pronounced and depend weakly on the location of the secondary channel. The mechanism responsible for amplification or reduction of the sea surface height in the main channel is identified and explained in terms of the forced wave and waves radiating away from the secondary channel. © 2013 Cambridge University Press.},

Rotifers dominated the community in periods of low to medium water ages. In periods of higher water ages the community was dominated by crustaceans. 5. We propose that the hydrological regime of floodplains is crucial for zooplankton biomass patterns and succession, through the alternation of washing-out effects, taxon-specific potential of reproduction and biological interactions. Flood events and high water levels reset the community to an early successional phase},

	abstract = {Geochemical and isotopic tracers (δ18O, δ2H, 87Sr/86Sr and δ13CTDIC) were used to constrain origins and chemical evolution of groundwater in a Mediterranean karst system. The Lez spring is the main perennial outlet of this karst system and supplies the metropolitan area of Montpellier (southern France) with drinking water. Groundwater samples were collected at the Lez spring and surrounding springs and wells under different hydrodynamic conditions during two hydrological years, from June 2008 until May 2010. The results show that multiple hydrological compartments interact through an important network of fractures and faults. They notably reveal connections between the main Jurassic limestone aquifer and the overlying Cretaceous (Valanginian) compartment, and between the surface and deep levels of the karst system. Isotopic tracers provided information about atmospheric recharge origins, lithological signatures and chemical evolution of waters. Long residence-time groundwaters, issued from deep layers have a Triassic hydrochemical fingerprinting, being enriched in δ13CTDIC and characterized by high concentrations in Cl- as well as high Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca and 87Sr/86Sr ratios. Evidences suggest that these waters mix with waters from the lower layers of the main Jurassic aquifer constitute an intermediate storage compartment prone to rise through piston-flow mechanism. A two-end member hydrograph separation based on {EC}-{TDS} was used to determine the proportion of the deep compartment's contribution to the Lez spring outflow. On average over the study period, the main aquifer compartment and the deep aquifer compartment are estimated to contribute 92.6\% and 7.4\% of groundwater flow at the Lez spring, respectively.},

	abstract = {A multi-proxy approach was used to examine the geomorphic dynamics and environmental history of an upper deltaic ﬂoodplain tract in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta, California. Three long cores were collected from the {McCormack}–Williamson Tract ({MWT}) and these cores were analyzed for bulk density, loss-on-ignition, ﬁne (clay and silt) content, Al concentration, magnetic susceptibility, pollen, and charcoal. Radiocarbon dates obtained for the cores were converted into calendar years and an age–depth model was constructed. Long-term vertical accretion and sedimentation rates were estimated from the age–depth model. Cross-core relations show that coarse sediment generally accumulates more rapidly and has greater magnetic susceptibility compared to ﬁne sediment. Percentage ﬁne and {LOI} data show a strong linear relationship that indicates ﬂooding is the primary mechanism for the deposition of particular organic matter on the ﬂoodplain and that landscape wash load has contributed a highly consistent fraction of persistent organic matter averaging 5·5 per cent to the site. Down-core grain size proﬁles show two hydrological domains in the cores, namely millennial ﬁne–coarse ﬂuctuations superimposed on general up-core ﬁning. Coarse sediment is viewed as channel or near-channel overbank deposits, whereas ﬁne deposits are considered to be distal overbank ﬂood deposits. The coarse–ﬁne ﬂuctuations are indicative of changing depositional settings as channels migrated laterally across {MWT}, whereas the upward ﬁning trend reﬂects a combination of self-limiting overbank deposition as ﬂoodplain elevation increased and decreasing competence as sea-level rise reduced ﬂood-pulse energy slopes. {MWT} has been cross-cut and incised numerous times in the past, only to have the channels abandoned and subsequently ﬁlled by ﬁne sediment. The channels around {MWT} attained their modern conﬁguration about 4000 years ago. {MWT} likely came under tidal inﬂuence at about 2500 cal {BP}. Wetlands have recently developed on {MWT}, but they are inorganic sediment dominated.},

	abstract = {While tens of millions of dollars have been spent on land acquisition and planning for current and future floodplain and wetland restoration in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, knowledge of the historical processes and landscape heterogeneity that are helpful in guiding the environmental restoration are often scarce. This study used palaeoenvironmental reconstruction to increase the historical perspective, with the aim of improving environmental management. Twelve sediment cores collected from the {McCormack}-Williamson Tract ({MWT}) leveed farmland and the juxtaposed Delta Meadows ({DM}) tidal wetland were sampled for a suite of environmental proxies. {MWT} was a non-tidal flood plain during much of the late-Holocene, with a mosaic of other habitats including dry uplands, riparian forests, and freshwater wetlands persisting nearby. Comparison with the regional sea-level history suggests that the upper delta gradually came under tidal influence 3000-800 calendar years before present (cal {BP}). Despite this, floodplain landforms and habitats prevailed at {DM} from 3650-330 cal {BP}, after which wetlands expanded, suggesting that a flood-based disturbance regime typified the upper delta for most of the late-Holocene. Recently, the upper deltaic plain has been profoundly disturbed by agriculture and other activities, rendering significant loss of habitat. It is believed that a flood-based disturbance regime will recur at {MWT} if the levees surrounding the tract are intentionally breached as planned for restoration, culminating in a variety of habitats similar to pre-agricultural conditions. Concentrations of Hg, Pb, As, and P pollutants elevated several-fold in surficial sediments are of particular concern, potentially becoming problematic after restoration.},

At the apex of a channel network in an Indonesian delta, observations of flow division suggest that tidally averaged flow division depends on the tidal range. To understand the mechanisms governing the subtidal flow division, an idealized hydrodynamic junction model inspired by the observations has been set up. The barotropic model consists of two exponentially converging tidal channels that connect to a tidal river at the junction and solves the nonlinear shallow water equations. By varying the depth, length, e-folding length scale of the channel width, and hydraulic roughness in one of the two tidal channels, the sensitivity of the subtidal flow division to those four parameters was investigated. For depth, length, and e-folding length scale differences between channels the effect of tides is generally to enhance unequal subtidal flow division that occurs in the case of river flow only. In contrast, for hydraulic roughness differences, the tidal effect partly cancels the inequality in river flow division. The tidal effect may even reverse the horizontal flow circulation that would occur in the absence of tides.},

	abstract = {Short-term variability of a conservative quantity (salinity) and two nonconservative quantities (chlorophyll a, suspended particulate matter) was measured across a sampling grid in the South San Francisco Bay estuary. Surface measurements were made every 2 h at each of 29 (or 38) sites, on four different dates representing a range of tidal current regimes over the neap-spring cycle. From the distribution of phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) and turbidity ({SPM}), we also estimated daily productivity and its variability at each site over the four tide cycles. As a general rule, both chlorophyll a and {SPM} concentrations varied about 50\% from their tidal-means. However derived daily productivity varied less (about 15\% from the mean) over a tidal cycle. Both chlorophyll a and {SPM} varied periodically with tidal stage (increasing on ebbing currents), suggesting that the short-term variability results simply from the tidal advection of spatial gradients. Calculation of the advective flux (current speed times spatial gradient) was used to test this hypothesis. For surface salinity, most (70-80\%) of the observed intratidal variability was correlated with the tidal flux, both in the deep channel and over the lateral shoals. However the short-term variability of {SPM} concentration was only weakly correlated with the advective flux, indicating that local sources of {SPM} (resuspension) are important. Hourly changes in chlorophyll a were highly correlated with the advective flux in the deep channel (implying that phytoplankton biomass is conservative over short time scales there); however, chlorophyll a variability was only weakly correlated with the advective flux over the shoals, implying that local sources/sinks are important there. Hence, the magnitude and mechanisms of intratidal variability differ among constituents and among bathymetric regimes in this estuary. © 1989.},

	abstract = {The concept of exposure time offers an interesting alternative to the residence time for the quantitative assessment of the water renewal of estuaries and semi-enclosed basins. It can cope with the oscillations or meandering of the flow around the boundary of the control domain and is therefore particularly suited for tidal seas and sub-basins with strong mesoscale activity.We show however that the exposure time in a control domain Ω cannot be properly defined if Ω is part of a larger bounded system unless some removal process is taken into account. It is therefore suggested to revise and extend the definition of the exposure time by including a first order decay: "the exposure time for the rate constant λ is the total time spent in a control domain Ω by particles subject to a first order decay with a rate constant λ, irrespective of their possible excursions in and out the control domain". The exposure time revised in this way is well-defined in all circumstances provided that the decay rate differs from zero but depends on the rate constant λ. Alternatively, in order to diagnose the movement of water masses, the first order decay can be considered only outside the control domain. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees ({BRT}), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final {BRT} model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3. Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in {BRT} overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although {BRT} models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4. The unique features of {BRT} raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using {BRT} through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of {BRT} by ecologists.},

In estuarine aquatic habitats, residence time (τ) is a major driver of biogeochemical processes, affecting trophic subsidies and conditions in fish-spawning habitats. But τ is highly variable in estuaries, owing to constant changes in river inflows, tides, wind, and water height, all of which combine to affect τ in unpredictable ways. It recently became feasible to measure δ2H and δ18O continuously, at a high sampling frequency (1 Hz), using diffusion sample introduction into a cavity ring-down spectrometer. To better understand the relationship of τ to biogeochemical processes in a dynamic estuarine system, we continuously measured δ2H and δ18O, nitrate and water quality parameters, on board a small, high-speed boat (5 to {\textgreater}10 m s–1) fitted with a hull-mounted underwater intake.

	abstract = {During the late Holocene, sediment deposition on the lowland Cosumnes River floodplain, {CA} has depended on factors that varied temporally and spatially, such as basin subsidence, sea level rise, flow, and sediment supply from both the Sacramento River system and from the Cosumnes River system itself, and anthropogenic changes. Through field investigations and analyses of historical maps, bridge core logs, and sediment size distributions, we link hydrogeomorphic processes to three stages of floodplain sedimentation on the lowland Cosumnes River. Stage I (1000-200 {YBP}) combined late Holocene pre-disturbance flood basin overflow and anastomosing river processes deposited spatially variable sediment consisting of gray-blue clay (87\% clay) interlayered with relatively thin coarser sediment. Pre-disturbance Holocene deposition rates of up to ∼3.0 mm/year kept pace with sea level rise and tectonic basin subsidence. Stage {II} (200 to ∼10 {YBP}) anthropogenic disturbances caused a rapid increase in floodplain sedimentation rates up to 25 mm/year between 1849 and ∼1920, and deposited a relatively coarser reddish-brown sandy clay (∼40\% clay) layer that overlies the basin deposits. Between ∼1920 and 1990 {AD}, sedimentation was greatly limited on the lower Cosumnes floodplain because levees inhibited connectivity between both the Sacramento and Cosumnes River systems and the Cosumnes floodplain. During this stage, the density of channel segments in the anastomosing river floodplain decreased by 30\% as agricultural activities filled secondary channels and leveled floodplain topography. During Stage {III} (∼10 {YBP} to the present), post-rehabilitation floodplain sand splay complex sediment deposited after 1998 {AD} resulted from intentionally breaching levees to promote habitat at the Cosumnes River Preserve. The splay complex is dominated by medium to very coarse sand with finer intervening layers. The post-rehabilitation splay complex overlies the older basin deposits in a generally upward coarsening sequence that reflects depositional processes and land use changes that continue to affect the lowland Cosumnes River floodplain. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Numerical modeling has emerged over the last several decades as a widely accepted tool for investigations in environmental sciences. In estuarine research, hydrodynamic and ecological models have moved along parallel tracks with regard to complexity, refinement, computational power, and incorporation of uncertainty. Coupled hydrodynamic-ecological models have been used to assess ecosystem processes and interactions, simulate future scenarios, and evaluate remedial actions in response to eutrophication, habitat loss, and freshwater diversion. The need to couple hydrodynamic and ecological models to address research and management questions is clear because dynamic feedbacks between biotic and physical processes are critical interactions within ecosystems. In this review, we present historical and modern perspectives on estuarine hydrodynamic and ecological modeling, consider model limitations, and address aspects of model linkage, skill assessment, and complexity. We discuss the balance between spatial and temporal resolution and present examples using different spatiotemporal scales. Finally, we recommend future lines of inquiry, approaches to balance complexity and uncertainty, and model transparency and utility. It is idealistic to think we can pursue a “theory of everything” for estuarine models, but recent advances suggest that models for both scientific investigations and management applications will continue to improve in terms of realism, precision, and accuracy.},

	abstract = {It has been estimated that over 90\% of the tidal freshwater wetlands of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region in California, {USA}, have been leveed, removing them from tidal and floodwater inundation. One alternative for restoration of tidal freshwater marsh ecosystems is to reconnect regions currently managed for agricultural purposes to the adjacent rivers and sloughs. Two elements of such restoration efforts that have not been adequately addressed are the impact that restoration efforts are likely to impose on flood stages, and the extent of various habitat types that may develop. This study tests the hypothesis that habitat restoration and flood mitigation can be compatible. {MIKE} 11, a one-dimensional, unsteady hydraulic model is used to evaluate the flood stage impacts of five restoration scenarios for the {McCormack}-Williamson Tract, located in the northern Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California, {USA}. In addition to quantifying flood impacts, model results are used to quantify the volume of tidal exchange, and integrated with {GIS} to quantify the potential areal extent of subtidal, intertidal, and supratidal habitat zones within the project. The results indicate that the restoration would provide a mosaic of habitat types, and have a minimal adverse impact upon flood stages during a range of flooding conditions. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The conceptual model consists of river, transitional, and bay regimes. Within the transitional regime, resuspension, advection, and deposition create a mass of sediment that oscillates landward and seaward. While suspended, this sediment mass forms an estuarine turbidity maximum. At slack tides this sediment mass temporarily deposits on the bed, creating landward and seaward deposits. Tidal excursion and slack tide deposition limit the range of the sediment mass. To verify this conceptual model, data from two small tributary rivers of San Pablo Bay are presented. Tidal variability of suspended-sediment concentration markedly differs between the landward and seaward deposits, allowing interpretation of the intratidal movement of the oscillating sediment mass. Application of this model in suitable estuaries will assist in numerical model calibration as well as in data interpretation. A similar model has been applied to some larger-scale European estuaries, which bear a geometric resemblance to the systems analyzed in this study. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The antipredator behavior diel vertical migration ({DVM}), common in aquatic keystone species Daphnia, involves daily migration from warmer surface waters before dawn to cooler deeper waters after dusk. Plasticity in Daphnia {DVM} behavior optimizes fitness via trade-offs between growth, reproduction, and predator avoidance. Migration behavior is affected by co-varying biotic and abiotic factors, including light, predator cues, and anthropogenic stressors making it difficult to determine each factor's individual contribution to the variation in this behavior. This study aims to better understand this ecologically significant behavior in Daphnia by: (1) determining how Daphnia pulicaria thermal preferences vary within and among natural populations; (2) distinguishing the role of temperature verses depth in Daphnia vertical migration; and (3) defining how two anthropogenic stressors (copper and nickel) impact Daphnia migratory behavior.Simulated natural lake stratification were constructed in 8 L (0.5 m tall, 14.5 cm wide) water columns to monitor under controlled laboratory conditions the individual effects of temperature gradients, depth, and metal stressors on Daphnia vertical migration. Three major findings are reported. First, while no difference in thermal preference was found among the four populations studied, within lake populations variability among isolates was high. Second, decoupling temperature and depth revealed that depth was a better predictor of Daphnia migratory patterns over temperature. Third, exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of copper or nickel inhibited classic {DVM} behavior. These findings revealed the high variability in thermal preference found within Daphnia populations, elucidated the individual roles that depth and temperature have on migratory behavior, and showed how copper and nickel can interfere with the natural response of Daphnia to fish predator cues. Thus contributing to the body of knowledge necessary to predict how natural populations of Daphnia will be affected by climate related changes in lake temperatures and increased presence of anthropogenic stressors.},

	title = {Baylands ecosystem habitat goals. A report of habitat recommendations prepared by the San Francisco Bay Area Wetlands Ecosystem Goals Project},
	abstract = {This report presents recommendations for the kinds, amounts, and distribution of wetlands and related habitats that are needed to sustain diverse and healthy communities of fish and wildlife resources in the San Francisco Bay Area. It represents the culmination of more than three years of work by scientists, resource managers, and other participants of the San Francisco Bay Area Wetlands Ecosystem Goals Project (Goals Project). The geographic scope of the Goals Project included portions of the San Francisco Estuary that are downstream of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. These include Suisun Bay, San Pablo Bay, and San Francisco Bay. Within this area, Project participants focused their attention on the baylands — the lands within the historical and modern boundaries of the tides — and adjacent areas. The San Francisco Estuary Project identified a need for habitat goals in 1993. Subsequent discussions among representatives of fish and wildlife agencies confirmed this need. The Goals Project began in 1995 and involved more than 100 participants representing local, state, and federal agencies, academia, and the private sector. Participants were organized in several groups, each of which had a unique role in developing the Goals. The Resource Managers Group, composed of representatives of state and federal resource agencies, oversaw the Project and was ultimately responsible for the content and format of the Goals. Developing the Goals The process for developing the Goals involved several steps. These included selecting key species and key habitats, assembling and evaluating information, preparing recommendations, and integrating recommendations into Goals. The Resource Managers Group decided to develop goals based on species needs because there was relatively abundant information available on bayland species and habitats. There was general agreement that goals developed to improve habitats for many kinds of plants and animals would concurrently provide other important wetlands services, such as nutrient cycling, flood control, and water quality improvement. In selecting key species of the baylands ecosystem, technical focus teams screened nearly 400 species of fish and wildlife and evaluated plant communities from the Bay to the adjacent uplands. The focus teams ultimately selected 120 species of invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds to represent the complexity of the baylands ecosystem. In developing the list of key habitats, Project participants reviewed habitat lists created for previous wetland planning efforts. Ultimately, they designated some two dozen key habitats of the baylands ecosystem. Most of the habitat designations had been commonly used in the region for years; however, some were one unique to the Project. After selecting key species and habitats, Project participants assembled qualitative and quantitative data on them and prepared initial habitat recommendations. These recommendations were integrated into a draft report that was circulated for public comment. This final report is based on the draft report, on verbal and written public comments submitted on the draft report, and on new information. Habitat Goals The Goals are presented at three levels of specificity — by region, by subregion, and by segment. The regional and subregional recommendations are fairly general and are summarized below. The segment recommendations are more detailed and are provided in the main body of the report. The Goals recommendations are founded on one important premise: There should be no additional loss of wetlands within the baylands ecosystem. Furthermore, as filled or developed areas within the baylands become available, their potential for restoration to fish and wildlife habitat should be fully considered. Regional Recommendations The Goals recommend major habitat changes region-wide. They call for: • Many large patches of tidal marsh connected by corridors to enable the movement of small mammals and marsh-dependent birds. • Several large complexes of salt ponds managed for shorebirds and waterfowl. • Extensive areas of managed seasonal ponds. • Large expanses of managed marsh. • Continuous corridors of riparian vegetation along the Bay’s tributary streams. • Restored beaches, natural salt ponds, and other unique habitats. • Intact patches of adjacent habitats, including grasslands, seasonal wetlands, and forests. This regional perspective embodies several ecological design principles which state that bayland restoration plans should: • Center tidal marsh restoration, where possible, around existing populations of threatened and endangered species. • Include restoration of tidal marsh along the salinity gradients of the Estuary and its tributaries.},

Here, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of appropriative water rights to identify where, and to what extent, water has been dedicated to human uses relative to natural supplies. The results show that water right allocations total 400 billion cubic meters, approximately five times the state’s mean annual runoff. In the state’s major river basins, water rights account for up to 1000\% of natural surface water supplies, with the greatest degree of appropriation observed in tributaries to the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and in coastal streams in southern California. Comparisons with water supplies and estimates of actual use indicate substantial uncertainty in how water rights are exercised. In arid regions such as California, over-allocation of surface water coupled with trends of decreasing supply suggest that new water demands will be met by re-allocation from existing uses. Without improvements to the water rights system, growing human and environmental demands portend an intensification of regional water scarcity and social conflict. California’s legal framework for managing its water resources is largely compatible with needed reforms, but additional public investment is required to enhance the capacity of the state’s water management institutions to effectively track and regulate water rights.},

	abstract = {We reared juvenile Chinook salmon for two consecutive flood seasons within various habitats of the Cosumnes River and its floodplain to compare fish growth in river and floodplain habitats. Fish were placed in enclosures during times when wild salmon would naturally be rearing in floodplain habitats. We found significant differences in growth rates between salmon reared in floodplain and river enclosures. Salmon reared in seasonally inundated habitats with annual terrestrial vegetation experienced higher growth rates than those reared in a perennial pond on the floodplain. Growth of fish in the non-tidal river upstream of the floodplain varied with flow in the river. When flows were high, there was little growth and high mortality, but when the flows were low and clear, the fish grew rapidly. Fish displayed very poor growth in tidally influenced river habitat below the floodplain, a habitat type to which juveniles are commonly displaced during high flow events due to a lack of channel complexity in the main-stem river. Overall, ephemeral floodplain habitats supported higher growth rates for juvenile Chinook salmon than more permanent habitats in either the floodplain or river. Variable responses in both growth and mortality, however, indicate the importance of providing habitat complexity for juvenile salmon in floodplain reaches of streams, so fish can find optimal places for rearing under different flow conditions. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The flood pulse is a "batch" process and is distinct from concepts that emphasize the continuous processes in flowing water environments, such as the river continuum concept. Floodplains are distinct because they do not depend on upstream processing inefficiencies of organic matter, although their nutrient pool is influenced by periodic lateral exchange of water and sediments with the main channel.},

	abstract = {We used hydrodynamic and particle-tracking models to investigate vertical movement of plankton and resulting retention in the San Francisco Estuary. The hydrodynamic model was {UnTRIM}, a three-dimensional, unstructured grid model, which had been calibrated to historical conditions in this estuary for 1994–1997, a period of widely varying hydrology. Intensive field studies of hydrodynamics and vertical movements of organisms during 1994–1996 provided input data for the models. The particle-tracking model was run with 14 alternative behaviors for three 45 d periods of contrasting hydrology. The behaviors included passive behavior, several simple tidal migration patterns, and several sinking speeds. Vertical positions of migrating and sinking particles resembled those seen in the field studies for copepods and epibenthos, respectively. Passive particles were advected from the estuary at rates that depended on freshwater flow. All of the non-passive behaviors caused retention of the particles in the low-salinity region of the estuary under some flow conditions. Tidal migration was very effective at maintaining position, but model results and a re-examination of the field data suggested that migration speed should increase with increasing freshwater flow. Continuous sinking was also effective at retention, particularly in deep areas of low tidal velocity. We conclude that the vertical distributions observed in the field studies were a result of active patterns of movement, that these patterns can result in retention, and that retention in a bathymetrically complex estuary can be understood only in the context of the full time-varying three-dimensional flow field.},

	abstract = {Floodplain inundation in rivers is thought to enhance fish recruitment by providing a suitable spawning environment and abundant food and habitat for larvae. Although this model has not previously been tested in Australian rivers, it is often extrapolated to fishes of the Murray-Darling Basin. Fortnightly sampling of larvae and juveniles was conducted in the unregulated Ovens River floodplain during spring-summer of 1999 (non-flood year) and 2000 (flood year). The only species that increased in larval abundance during or shortly after flooding was an introduced species, common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Additionally, the peak abundance of larvae on the floodplain occurred during a rapidly declining hydrograph under low flow conditions in isolated billabongs and anabranches. The low use of the inundated floodplain for recruitment contradicts previous models. We propose a model of the optimum environmental conditions required for use of the inundated floodplain for fish recruitment. The model suggests that the notion of the flood pulse alone controlling fish recruitment is too simplistic to describe all strategies within a system. Rather, the life history adaptations in the fauna of the system and aspects of the hydrological regime such as duration and timing of inundation will control the response of a river's fish fauna to flooding.},

	abstract = {Dredging is frequently used in the river mouths of eutrophic lakes to reduce internal phosphorus (P) loading from the sediment. However, the accumulation of P-adsorbed suspended particulate matter ({SPM}) from the inflowing rivers negatively affects the post-dredging sediment-water interface and ultimately increases internal P loading. Here, a 360-d experiment was carried out to investigate the influence of riverine {SPM} on the efficacy of dredging in reducing internal P loading. {SPM} was added to dredged and undredged sediments collected from the confluence area of Lake Chaohu. Several parameters related to internal P loading, including oxygen profile, soluble reactive P, and ferrous iron across the sediment-water interface, organic matter, alkaline phosphatase activity, and P fractions, were measured throughout the experimental period. The results showed that the P content (especially mobile P) in the sediment increased to the pre-dredging level with the accumulation of {SPM} in the dredged sediment. In addition, the P flux across the sediment-water interface increased with the accumulation of {SPM}. Several characteristics of {SPM}, including high organic matter content, mobile P, high activity of alkaline phosphatase, and high biological activity, were considered correlated with the post-dredging increase in internal P loading. Overall, this study showed that the heavily contaminated riverine {SPM} regulates the long-term efficacy of dredging as a nutrient management option in the confluence area. Management is needed to avoid or reduce this phenomenon during dredging projects of this nature.},

	abstract = {The development and distribution of phytoplankton blooms in estuaries are functions of both local conditions (i.e, the production-loss balance for a water column at a particular spatial location) and large-scale horizontal transport. In this study, the second of a 2-paper series, we use a depth-averaged hydrodynamic-biological model to identify transport-related mechanisms impacting phytoplankton biomass accumulation and distribution on a system level. We chose South San Francisco Bay as a model domain. since its combination of a deep channel surrounded by broad shoals is typical of drowned-river estuaries. Five general mechanisms involving interaction of horizontal transport with variability in local conditions are discussed. Residual (on the order of days to weeks) transport mechanisms affecting bloom development and location include residence time/export, import, and the role of deep channel regions as conduits for mass transport. Interactions occurring on tidal time scales, i.e. (on the order of hours) include the phasing of lateral oscillatory tidal flow relative to temporal changes in local net phytoplankton growth rates, as well as lateral sloshing of shoal-derived biomass into deep channel regions during ebb and back into shallow regions during flood tide. Based on these results, we conclude that: (1) while local conditions control whether a bloom is possible, the combination of transport and spatial-temporal variability in local conditions determines if and where a bloom will actually occur; (2) tidal-time-scale physical-biological interactions provide important mechanisms for bloom development and evolution. As a result of both subtidal and tidal-time-scale transport processes. peak biomass may not be observed where local conditions are most favorable to phytoplankton production, and inherently unproductive areas may be regions of high biomass accumulation.},

	abstract = {Non-native species are a prevalent ecosystem stressor that can interact with other stressors to confound resource management and restoration. We examine how interactions between physical habitat attributes and a particular category of non-native species (invasive bivalves) influence primary production in aquatic ecosystems. Using mathematical models, we show how intuitive relationships between phytoplankton productivity and controllable physical factors (water depth, hydraulic transport time) that hold in the absence of bivalves can be complicated—and even reversed—by rapid bivalve grazing. In light- limited environments without bivalves, shallow, hydrodynamically ‘‘slow’’ habitats should generally have greater phytoplankton biomass and productivity than deeper, ‘‘faster’’ habitats. But shallower, slower environments can be less productive than deeper, faster ones if benthic grazing is strong. Moreover, shallower and slower waters exhibit a particularly broad range of possible productivity outcomes that can depend on whether bivalves are present. Since it is difficult to predict the response of non-native bivalves to habitat restoration, outcomes for new shallow, slow environments can be highly uncertain. Habitat depth and transport time should therefore not be used as indicators of phytoplankton biomass and production where bivalve colonization is possible. This study provides for ecosystem management a particular example of a broad lesson: abiotic ecosystem stressors should be managed with explicit consideration of interactions with other major (including biotic) stressors.We discuss the applicability and management implications of our models and results for a range of aquatic system types, with a case study focused on the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (California, {USA}). Simple mathematical models like those used here can illuminate interactions between ecosystem stressors and provide process-based guidance for resource managers as they develop strategies to augment valued populations, restore habitats, and manipulate ecosystem functions.

	abstract = {A pseudo-two-dimensional numerical model of estuarine phytoplankton growth and consumption, vertical turbulent mixing, and idealized cross-estuary transport was developed and applied to South San Francisco Bay. This estuary has two bathymetrically distinct habitat types (deep channel, shallow shoal) and associated differences in local net rates of phytoplankton growth and consumption, as well as differences in the water column's tendency to stratify. Because many physical and biological time scales relevant to algal population dynamics decrease with decreasing depth, process rates can be especially fast in the shallow water. We used the model to explore the potential significance of hydrodynamic connectivity between a channel and shoal and whether lateral transport can allow physical or biological processes (e.g. stratification, benthic grazing, light attenuation) in one sub-region to control phytoplankton biomass and bloom development in the adjacent sub-region. Model results for South San Francisco Bay suggest that lateral transport from a productive shoal can result in phytoplankton biomass accumulation in an adjacent deep, unproductive channel. The model further suggests that turbidity and benthic grazing in the shoal can control the occurrence of a bloom system-wide; whereas, turbidity, benthic grazing, and vertical density stratification in the channel are likely to only control local bloom occurrence or modify system-wide bloom magnitude. Measurements from a related field program are generally consistent with model-derived conclusions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

In many cases, empirical data are consistent with a positive phytoplankton-transport time relationship (i.e., phytoplankton biomass increases as transport time increases). However, negative relationships, varying relationships, or no significant relationship may also be observed. We present a simple conceptual model, in both mathematical and graphical form, to help explain why phytoplankton may have a range of relationships with transport time, and we apply it to several real systems. The phytoplankton growth-loss balance determines whether phytoplankton biomass increases with, decreases with, or is insensitive to transport time. If algal growth is faster than loss (e. g., grazing, sedimentation), then phytoplankton biomass increases with increasing transport time. If loss is faster than growth, phytoplankton biomass decreases with increasing transport time. If growth and loss are approximately balanced, then phytoplankton biomass is relatively insensitive to transport time. In analyses of several systems, portions of an individual system, or time periods, apparent insensitivity of phytoplankton biomass to changes in transport time could arise due to the superposition of cases with different phytoplankton-transport time relationships. Thus, in order to understand or predict responses of phytoplankton biomass to changes in transport time, the relative rates of algal growth and loss must be known.},

	abstract = {At the fringe of Everglades National Park in southwest Florida, United States, the Ten Thousand Islands National Wildlife Refuge ({TTINWR}) habitat has been heavily affected by the disruption of natural freshwater flow across the Tamiami Trail (U.S. Highway 41). As the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan ({CERP}) proposes to restore the natural sheet flow from the Picayune Strand Restoration Project area north of the highway, the impact of planned measures on the hydrology in the refuge needs to be taken into account. The objective of this study was to develop a simple, computationally efficient mass balance model to simulate the spatial and temporal patterns of water level and salinity within the area of interest. This model could be used to assess the effects of the proposed management decisions on the surface water hydrological characteristics of the refuge. Surface water variations are critical to the maintenance of wetland processes. The model domain is divided into 10 compartments on the basis of their shared topography, vegetation, and hydrologic characteristics. A diversion of +10\% of the discharge recorded during the modeling period was simulated in the primary canal draining the Picayune Strand forest north of the Tamiami Trail (Faka Union Canal) and this discharge was distributed as overland flow through the refuge area. Water depths were affected only modestly. However, in the northern part of the refuge, the hydroperiod, i.e., the duration of seasonal flooding, was increased by 21 days (from 115 to 136 days) for the simulation during the 2008 wet season, with an average water level rise of 0.06 m. The average salinity over a two-year period in the model area just south of Tamiami Trail was reduced by approximately 8 practical salinity units (psu) (from 18 to 10 psu), whereas the peak dry season average was reduced from 35 to 29 psu (by 17\%). These salinity reductions were even larger with greater flow diversions (+20\%). Naturally, the reduction in salinity diminished toward the open water areas where the daily flood tides mix in saline bay water. Partially restoring hydrologic flows to {TTINWR} will affect hydroperiod and salinity regimes within downslope wetlands, and perhaps serve as a management tool to reduce the speed of future encroachment of mangroves into marsh as sea levels rise. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

The San Joaquin River makes up the southern portion of the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta, the eastern end of San Francisco Bay. Observations made in August 2004 and August 2005 show significant diurnal variations in temperature in response to surface heat exchange. However, to account for observed changes in heat content a sizeable downstream heat flux (approximately 100 W m−2) must be added to the surface heat flux. To account for this flux via Fickian dispersion, a flow-dependent dispersion coefficient varying from 500 to 4,000 m2 s−1 is needed. These values are much larger than would be predicted for a river of this size, suggesting that the complex topology of the Delta greatly enhances longitudinal dispersion. Building on these observations, we present a simple theory that explores how the subtidal temperature field varies in response to changes in flow rate, dispersion, and heat exchange.},

This tool was applied on a river stretch commonly occurring in Belgium and elsewhere in Europe. In particular the effect of weir removal on habitat suitability for bullhead (Cottus gobio L.) was simulated. Physical conditions of the studied stretch after weir removal were simulated with a hydraulic model. {CASiMiR} linked these conditions to ecological expert knowledge to calculate habitat suitability for three life stages of bullhead at four different flow rates based on fuzzy logic. Results indicated that after weir removal, habitat suitability increased significantly for all life stages and all flow rates. The presented approach is promising regarding fish community assessment and ecological river engineering. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the challenge of representing structural differences in river channel cross-section geometry for regional to global scale river hydraulic models and the effect this can have on simulations of wave dynamics. Classically, channel geometry is defined using data, yet at larger scales the necessary information and model structures do not exist to take this approach. We therefore propose a fundamentally different approach where the structural uncertainty in channel geometry is represented using a simple parameterisation, which could then be estimated through calibration or data assimilation. This paper first outlines the development of a computationally efficient numerical scheme to represent generalised channel shapes using a single parameter, which is then validated using a simple straight channel test case and shown to predict wetted perimeter to within 2\% for the channels tested. An application to the River Severn, {UK} is also presented, along with an analysis of model sensitivity to channel shape, depth and friction. The channel shape parameter was shown to improve model simulations of river level, particularly for more physically plausible channel roughness and depth parameter ranges. Calibrating channel Manning's coefficient in a rectangular channel provided similar water level simulation accuracy in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency to a model where friction and shape or depth were calibrated. However, the calibrated Manning coefficient in the rectangular channel model was ∼2/3 greater than the likely physically realistic value for this reach and this erroneously slowed wave propagation times through the reach by several hours. Therefore, for large scale models applied in data sparse areas, calibrating channel depth and/or shape may be preferable to assuming a rectangular geometry and calibrating friction alone.},

	abstract = {The phosphorus content of fluvial sediment (suspended sediment and the {\textless}63??m fraction of floodplain and channel bed sediment) has been examined in contrasting rural (moorland and agricultural) and industrialized catchments in Yorkshire, {UK}. The River Swale drains a rural catchment with no major urban and industrial areas, and the total phosphorus ({TP}) content of fluvial sediment is generally within the range 500-1500??gg-1. There is little evidence of any major downstream increase in {TP} content. In contrast, fluvial sediment from the industrialized catchments of the Rivers Aire and Calder exhibits both higher levels of {TP} content and marked downstream increases, with values of {TP} content ranging from {\textless}2000??gg-1 in headwater areas upstream of the main urban and industrial areas, to values {\textgreater}7000??gg-1 at downstream sites. These elevated levels reflect P inputs from point sources, such as sewage treatment works ({STWs}) and combined sewer overflows. The influence of {STWs} is further demonstrated by the downstream increase in the inorganic P/organic P ratio from {\textless}2 in the headwaters to {\textgreater}4 in the lower reaches. Comparison of the P content of suspended sediment with that of the {\textless}63??m fraction of potential source materials suggests that topsoil from upland moorland/pasture and from cultivated areas, and channel bank material are likely to be the main sources of particulate P ({PP}) in the River Swale and in the headwaters of the Rivers Aire and Calder. In the middle and lower reaches of the Rivers Aire and Calder, inputs associated with urban and industrial land uses, such as {STWs}, industrial effluents and street dust, are likely to represent the dominant sources of {PP}. During high flow events, such urban inputs may be diluted by inputs from moorland and agricultural land in the headwaters. Consequently, for all three rivers, there are inverse relationships between the {TP} content of suspended sediment and both discharge and suspended sediment concentration, reflecting changes in sediment and P sources during high flow events. Spatial variations in the P contents of the {\textless}63??m fraction of overbank floodplain deposits and channel bed sediment evidence a similar pattern as those for suspended sediment, with relatively low levels of {TP} in the River Swale and elevated levels in the middle and downstream reaches of the Rivers Aire and Calder. The {PP} concentrations associated with floodplain and channel bed sediment are, however, lower than equivalent values for suspended sediment, and this primarily reflects the differences in the particle size composition between the three types of sediments. Rates of floodplain deposition and the amounts of fine-grained sediment stored in the river channels are relatively high, and suggest that such environments may represent important sinks for {PP}. Based on the sediment samples collected from the study basins, a simple four-fold classification which relates the {TP} content of suspended sediment to upstream land use has been established. Both the range and the absolute values of {TP} content tend to increase with an increase in the level of urbanization and industrialization. Copyright ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	volume = {7},
	abstract = {. We define disturbance in stream ecosystems to be: any relatively discrete event in time that is characterized by a frequency, intensity, and severity outside a predictable range, and that disrupts ecosystem, community, or population structure and changes resources or the physical environment. Of the three major hypotheses relating disturbance to lotic community structure, the dynamic equilibrium hypothesis appears to be generally applicable, although specific studies support the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and the equilibrium model. Differences in disturbance frequency between lentic and lotic systems may explain why biotic interactions are more apparent in lakes than in streams. Responses to both natural and anthropogenic disturbances vary regionally, as illustrated by examples from the mid-continent, Pacific northwest, and southeastern United States. Based on a generalized framework of climatic-biogeochemical characteristics, two features are considered to be most significant in choosing streams for comparative studies of disturbance: hydrologic regimes and comparable geomorphology. A method is described for quantifying predictability of the hy- drologic regime based on long-term records of monthly maximum and minimum stream flows. Different channel forms (boulder and cobble, alluvial gravelbed, alluvial sandbed) have different responses to hydrologic disturbance from spates. A number of structural and functional components for comparing disturbance effects within regions and across biomes are presented. Experimental approaches to studying disturbance involve spatial-scale considerations, logistic difficulties, and ethical questions.

	abstract = {Tidal rivers feature oscillatory and steady gradients in the water surface, controlled by interactions between river flow and tides. The river discharge attenuates the tidal motion, and tidal motion increases tidal-mean friction in the river, which may act as a barrier to the river discharge. Time series of tidal water level amplitudes at five gauge stations along the River Mahakam in Indonesia, and tidal flow velocity amplitudes at a discharge monitoring station were obtained applying wavelet analysis. Temporal variations in tidal damping coefficients for quaterdiurnal, semidiurnal, and diurnal tidal species were quantified from the observed amplitude profiles. The analysis shows that tidal damping during the rising limb of a discharge wave differs from damping during the falling limb. Wavelet cross-correlations between surface levels yielded empirical estimates of wave numbers. An empirical relation between tidal damping and river flow is derived to describe subtidal bottom friction along an idealized tidal river resembling the Mahakam. The subtidal friction is decomposed into contributions from the river flow only, from river-tide interaction, and from tidal asymmetry. Even for high river flow and low tidal velocity, river flow enhances friction attributed to river-tide interaction, causing subtidal water level setup. A simple multilinear regression model using subtidal bottom friction is employed to predict subtidal water levels at locations upstream, with a relatively good agreement between predictions and observations. The explicit expression shows the nonlinear dependence of subtidal friction on river flow velocity, explaining the complex behavior of tidal-mean surface level profiles. © 2013.

	abstract = {Individual based simulations of population dynamics require the availability of growth models with adequate complexity. For this purpose a simple-to-use model (non-linear multiple regression approach) is presented describing somatic growth and reproduction of Daphnia as a function of time, temperature and food quantity. The model showed a good agreement with published observations of somatic growth (r2 = 0.954, n = 88) and egg production (r2 = 0.898, n = 35). Temperature is the main determinant of initial somatic growth and food concentration is the main determinant of maximal body length and clutch size. An individual based simulation was used to demonstrate the simultaneous effects of food and temperature on the population level. Evidently, both temperature and food supply affected the population growth rate but at food concentrations above approximately 0.4 mg Cl−1 Scenedesmus acutus temperature appeared as the main determinant of population growth.  Four simulation examples are given to show the wide applicability of the model: (1) analysis of the correlation between population birth rate and somatic growth rate, (2) contribution of egg development time and delayed somatic growth to temperature-effects on population growth, (3) comparison of population birth rate in simulations with constant vs. decreasing size at maturity with declining food concentrations and (4) costs of diel vertical migration. Due to its plausible behaviour over a broad range of temperature (2–20 °C) and food conditions (0.1–4 mg Cl−1) the model can be used as a module for more detailed simulations of Daphnia population dynamics under realistic environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Diel vertical migration ({DVM}) of Daphnia is a well-studied inducible defence mechanism against predation by fish. Our study is anchored in constructing an individual-based model of {DVM} in order to bring established knowledge about essential key processes into a synthesis. For that purpose, we combined information about both proximate and ultimate factors of {DVM} with the intention to unify published results from these historically separated lines of research. The model consists of three submodels: (i) movements, (ii) growth and reproduction, and (iii) mortality. The submodel "movements" includes algorithms for light-dependent migration behaviour of Daphnia that were able to reproduce spatiotemporal distribution patterns of {DVM}. By means of scenario analyses, we tested the predator avoidance hypothesis by comparing population growth rates of migrating and non-migrating populations over a range of fish biomasses in the habitat. This enabled us to quantify the adaptive value of {DVM} under various environmental settings. Simulation results supported the predator avoidance hypothesis and showed a particularly high adaptive value of {DVMif} fish predation is intense. However, since {DVM} is associated with costs, a certain predation pressure in the habitat has to be prevailing in order to turn {DVM} into an adaptive strategy. Otherwise, if fish predation is weak, migrating populations realize lower population growth rates than non-migrating populations. In a second scenario, we tested the influence of vertical gradients of temperature and food on the adaptive value of {DVM}. We found a great potential to maximize the adaptive value of {DVM} if daphnids are able to modify their migration amplitude in dependence of the vertical structure of their habitat. For example, a deep chlorophyll maximum ({DCM}) can be a strong attractor for Daphnia to modify the migration amplitude in such a way that the daytime depth corresponds to the depth of the {DCM}. However, flexibility of the migration amplitude is only advantageous if the predation intensity is moderate - if predation is intense, only maximum migration amplitudes maximize fitness. © 2008 Elsevier {GmbH}.

	abstract = {Abstract  A study was conducted between April 2004 and September 2005 to estimate groundwater and nutrient discharge to the Neuse River{\textbackslash}nestuary in North Carolina. The largest groundwater fluxes were observed to occur generally within 20 m of the shoreline. Groundwater{\textbackslash}nflux estimates based on seepage meter measurements ranged from 2.86 × 108 to 4.33 × 108 m3 annually and are comparable to estimates made using radon, a simple water-budget method, and estimates derived by using Darcy’s{\textbackslash}{nLaw} and previously published general aquifer characteristics of the area. The lower groundwater flux estimate (equal to about{\textbackslash}n9 m3 s−1), which assumed the narrowest groundwater discharge zone (20 m) of three zone widths selected for an area west of New Bern,{\textbackslash}{nNorth} Carolina, most closely agrees with groundwater flux estimates made using radon (3–9 m3 s−1) and Darcy’s Law (about 9 m3 s−1). A groundwater flux of 9 m3 s−1 is about 40\% of the surface-water flow to the Neuse River estuary between Streets Ferry and the mouth of the estuary and{\textbackslash}nabout 7\% of the surface-water inflow from areas upstream. Estimates of annual nitrogen (333 tonnes) and phosphorus (66 tonnes){\textbackslash}nfluxes from groundwater to the estuary, based on this analysis, are less than 6\% of the nitrogen and phosphorus inputs derived{\textbackslash}nfrom all sources (excluding oceanic inputs), and approximately 8\% of the nitrogen and 17\% of the phosphorus annual inputs{\textbackslash}nfrom surface-water inflow to the Neuse River estuary assuming a mean annual precipitation of 1.27 m. We provide quantitative{\textbackslash}nevidence, derived from three methods, that the contribution of water and nutrients from groundwater discharge to the Neuse{\textbackslash}{nRiver} estuary is relatively minor, particularly compared with upstream sources of water and nutrients and with bottom sediment{\textbackslash}nsources of nutrients. Locally high groundwater discharges do occur, however, and could help explain the occurrence of localized{\textbackslash}nphytoplankton blooms, submerged aquatic vegetation, or fish kills.},

The three-dimensional hydrodynamic model of Clifton Court Forebay ({CCF}) was validated through comparison to observed water surface elevations inside {CCF}, and comparisons to observed drifter paths and velocity measurements collected by the {USGS} as part of this study. The model predicts water surface elevations and currents inside {CCF} accurately over a range of wind and operating conditions. The validated model was used to predict residence time of particles entering {CCF} to provide estimates of the amount of time delta smelt may remain in {CCF} before reaching the fish facility. These residence time estimates may be useful in estimations of pre-screen losses inside {CCF} due to predation or other causes.},

Solutions to this smoothing problem tend to be computationally complex, and not to provide model smooth functions which are appropriate for incorporating as components of other models, such as generalized additive models, or mixed additive models. In this paper we propose a class of smoothers appropriate for smoothing over difﬁcult regions of R2, which can be represented in terms of a low rank basis and one or two quadratic penalties. The key features of these smoothers are (i) that they do not ‘smooth across’ boundary features; (ii) that their representation in terms of a basis and penalties allows straightforward incorporation as components of {GAMs}, mixed models and other non-standard models; (iii) that smoothness selection for these model components is straightforward to accomplish in a computationally efﬁcient manner via {GCV}, {AIC} or {REML}, for example; (iv) that their low rank means that their use is computationally efﬁcient.},

An extension of the k–x model for buoyancy aﬀected and rotating ﬂows is suggested. Model performance is evaluated for a few typical oceanic ﬂows. First, new analytical solutions of the models for the surface layer aﬀected by breaking surface waves are discussed. The deﬁciencies of earlier attempts are high-lighted, and it is demonstrated why the Mellor–Yamada model and the k–  model fail. It is illustrated that only one version of the k–x model computes correct decay rates for turbulent quantities under breaking waves. Second, it is demonstrated that all models predict almost identical mixed layer depths and proﬁles for the turbulent kinetic energy in a classical stratiﬁed shear-entrainment experiment if the buoyancy term in the second equation is appropriately weighted. Third, the accuracy and numerical robustness of the new k–x model in realistic oceanic situations is conﬁrmed by comparison with the data-set of the Ocean Weather Ship Ô{PapaÕ}.},

	abstract = {The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta of California once was a great tidal freshwater marsh blanketed by peat and peaty alluvium. Beginning in the late 1800s, levees were built along the stream channels, and the land thus protected from flooding was drained, cleared, and planted. Although the Delta is now an exceptionally rich agricultural area (over a \$500 million crop value in 1993), its unique value is as a source of freshwater for the rest of the State. It is the heart of a massive north-to-south water- delivery system. Much of this water is pumped southward for use in the San Joaquin Valley and elsewhere in central and southern California. The leveed tracts and islands help to protect water-export facilities in the southern Delta from saltwater intrusion by displacing water and maintaining favorable freshwater gradients. However, ongoing subsidence behind the levees reduces levee stability and, thus, threatens to degrade water quality in the massive north-to-south water-transfer system.},

Two datasets are examined: the first is 23 years of daily salinity data taken by the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation along the axis of northern San Francisco Bay; the second is a set of salinity transects taken by the U. S. Geological Survey between 1988 and 1993. Central to this paper is a measure of salinity intrusion, X-2 : the distance from the Golden Gate Bridge to where the bottom salinity is 2 psu. Using X-2 to scale distance, the authors find that for most flow conditions, the mean salinity distribution of the estuary is nearly self-similar with a salinity gradient in the center 70\% of the region between the Golden Gate and X-2 that is proportional to X-2(-1). Analysis of covariability of Q and X-2 showed a characteristic timescale of adjustment of the salinity field of approximately 2 weeks. The steady-state response deduced from the X-2 time series implies that X-2 is proportional to riverflow to the 1/7 power. This relation, which differs from the standard 1/3 power dependence that is derived theoretically assuming constant exchange coefficients, shows that the upstream salt flux associated with gravitational circulation is more sensitive to the longitudinal salinity gradient than theory supposes. This is attributed to the strengthening of stratification caused by the stronger longitudinal salinity gradient that accompanies larger river flows.},

	abstract = {Eutrophication increases primary production and changes the relative abundance, taxonomic composition and spatial distribution of primary producers within an aquatic ecosystem. The changes in composition and location of resources alter the distribution and flow of energy and biomass throughout the food web. Changes in productivity also alter the physico-chemical environment, which has further effects on the biota. Such ecological changes influence the direction and strength of natural and sexual selection experienced by populations. Besides altering selection, they can also erode the habitat gradients and/or behavioural mechanisms that maintain ecological separation and reproductive isolation among species. Consequently, eutrophication of lakes commonly results in reduced ecological specialization as well as genetic and phenotypic homogenization among lakes and among niches within lakes. We argue that the associated loss in functional diversity and niche differentiation may lead to decreased carrying capacity and lower resource-use efficiency by consumers. We show that in central European whitefish species radiations, the functional diversity affected by eutrophication-induced speciation reversal correlates with community-wide trophic transfer efficiency (fisheries yield per unit phosphorus). We take this as an example of how evolutionary dynamics driven by anthropogenic environmental change can have lasting effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.This article is part of the themed issue \{{\textbackslash}textquoteleft\}Human influences on evolution, and the ecological and societal consequences\{{\textbackslash}textquoteright\}.},

	doi = {10.1111/oik.01463},
	abstract = {The question whether and how diversity-mediated productivity at the base of food-webs influences adjacent trophic levels is still unclear. Experiments revealed negative effects on consumers due to the increasing dominance of inedible species under grazing pressure, and positive effects due to a greater variety of prey resources. We experimentally investigate two more hypotheses, which have not been addressed in detail so far: first, more diverse primary producer communities potentially use limiting resources more efficiently, and are, therefore, more productive. This effect can be considered functionally similar to a direct enrichment with limiting resources, potentially resulting in a higher stochastic risk of herbivore extinction (‘paradox of enrichment’). Second, in a stable environment, enclosed primary producer communities should evolve towards a ‘climax state’, eventually dominated by one or few prey species. Therefore, long-term diversity effects in producer communities should more likely result from the specific traits of the dominating species, than from complementarity. To address these hypotheses, we conducted long-term laboratory experiments, exposing the freshwater grazer Daphnia magna to a gradient of algal species richness (1, 2, 4 or 8 edible chlorophyte species). The experiments were run in batch cultures, without exchange of growth medium after the start of the experiment. Six parameters related to Daphnia population demography, biomass accrual, and stability were followed and determined over a period of up to 263 days. Producer diversity exhibited strong positive effects on the short-term performance of grazers (first reproduction, first population peak), and on grazer mean standing stocks. However, herbivore long-term dynamics (day of extinction and temporal stability) depended on prey species identity, namely the presence of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Our experiments suggest that both prey diversity and identity can have positive effects on consumer performance, but act on different time scales.},

	abstract = {As a result of human activities, coastal waters can be exposed to multiple stressors that affect primary producers and their interactions with higher trophic levels. Mesocosm experiments were conducted during spring and summer 1996-1998 to investigate the responses of natural populations of primary producers to multiple stressors and the potential for these responses to be transmitted to higher trophic levels (i.e., copepods, bivalves, anemones, and fish). ne effects of two stressors, elevated nutrient and trace element loadings, were examined individually and in combination. Nutrient additions had a positive effect on biomass, productivity, and abundance of primary producers (Breitburg et al. 1999; Riedel et al. 2003). Growth or abundance of consumers increased with nutrient additions, but the magnitude of the response was reduced relative to that of their prey. Responses to trace element additions varied seasonally and among taxa. The responses of zooplankton and bivalves to stressor additions were affected by the biomass and changes in species composition of phytoplankton assemblages. The presence of fish predators did not alter zooplankton responses to stressor additions. These results suggest that the extent to which nutrient and trace element effects are transmitted from primary producers to higher trophic levels depends on the capacity of consumers to respond to stressor-induced changes in abundance and species composition of prey, on the absolute abundance of prey, and on the ability of predators to feed on alternative prey. The magnitude of the effects of stressors on estuarine food webs may depend on seasonal variability in species composition of phytoplankton assemblages, whether sensitive species dominate, and whether these species are important prey for secondary consumers. Because spatial and temporal patterns in nutrient and trace element loadings to the estuary can affect species composition of primary producers, it is critically important to examine the magnitude, timing, and spatial relationships of loadings of multiple stressors to coastal waters in order to understand the impacts of these stressors on higher trophic levels.},

Land managers and planners require a consistent set of protocols that include both the physical and biological aspects of the stream for effectiveness monitoring procedures to evaluate management activities in forested watersheds. We apply a quantitative method to estimate salmonid populations and link these estimates to a set of physical variables used in an assessment of channel condition at the reach scale. We are able to obtain precise estimates of juvenile salmonid populations at the habitat and reach scale; however, we find a lack of strong relationships between channel condition variables and salmonid densities. Nonetheless, a few trends appear, such as relationships between coho salmon and both pools and large wood. A significant and positive relationship exists between coho salmon fry density and two measures of pool frequency. Our results suggest that the response of fish populations to changes in the amount and quality of habitat can be measured by using the tested procedures. Complexity in habitat use, seasonal effects, and external factors tend to mask close relationships between fish populations and physical variables. We also discuss the implications for trophic status for fish populations and how this information may provide a more robust evaluation of land management activities on the aquatic biota in managed watersheds. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

For this stud- y, we analyzed such time series datasets from three Gulf of Mexico estuaries: Grand Bay, {MS}; Weeks Bay, {AL}; and Apalachicola Bay, {FL}. Data were acquired from {NOAA}'s National Estuarine Research Reserve System Wide Monitoring Program and used to calculate gross primary production ({GPP}), ecosystem respiration ({ER}), and net eco- system metabolism ({NEM}) using Odum's open watermethod. The three systems represent a diversity of estuaries typical of the Gulf {ofMexico} region, varying by as much as two orders of magnitude in key physical characteristics, such as estuarine area, watershed area, freshwater flow, and nutrient loading. In all three systems, {GPP} and {ER} displayed strong seasonality, peaking in summer and being lowest duringwinter. Peak rates of {GPP} and {ER} exceeded 200 mmol O2m−2 day−1 in all three estuaries. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining long-term trends in rates of {GPP}, {ER}, and {NEM} in estuaries. Variability in metabolism tended to be small among sites within each estuary. Nitrogen loading was highest in Weeks Bay, almost two times greater than that in Apalachicola Bay and 35 times greater than to Grand Bay. These differences in nitrogen loading were reflected in average annual {GPP} rates, whichrangedfrom825 g Cm−2 year−1 {inWeeks} Bay to 401 g Cm−2 year−1 for Apalachicola Bay and 377 g C m−2 year−1 in Grand Bay.Despite the strong inter-annual patterns in freshwa- ter flow and salinity, variability in metabolic rates was low, perhaps reflecting shifts in the relative importance of benthic and phytoplankton productivity, during different flow regimes. The advantage of the open water method is that it uses readily available and cost-effective sonde monitoring technology to estimate these fundamental estuarine processes, thus providing a potentialmeans for examining long-term trends in net carbon balance. It also provides a historical benchmark for comparison to ongoing and future monitoring focused on documenting the effect of human activities on the coastal zone.},

	abstract = {Phytoplankton blooms are prominent features of biological variability in shallow coastal ecosystems such as estuaries, lagoons, bays, and tidal rivers. Long-term observation and research in San Francisco Bay illustrates some patterns of phytoplankton spatial and temporal variability and the underlying mechanisms of this variability. Blooms are events of rapid production and accumulation of phytoplankton biomass that are usually responses to changing physical forcings originating in the coastal ocean (e.g., tides), the atmosphere (wind), or on the land surface (precipitation and river runoff). These physical forcings have different timescales of variability, so algal blooms can be short-term episodic events, recurrent seasonal phenomena, or rare events associated with exceptional climatic or hydrologic conditions. The biogeochemical role of phytoplankton primary production is to transform and incorporate reactive inorganic elements into organic forms, and these transformations are rapid and lead to measurable geochemical change during blooms. Examples include the depletion of inorganic nutrients (N, P, Si), supersaturation of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide, shifts in the isotopic composition of reactive elements (C, N), production of climatically active trace gases (methyl bromide, dimethylsulfide), changes in the chemical form and toxicity of trace metals (As, Cd, Ni, Zn), changes in the biochemical composition and reactivity of the suspended particulate matter, and synthesis of organic matter required for the reproduction and growth of heterotrophs, including bacteria, zooplankton, and benthic consumer animals. Some classes of phytoplankton play special roles in the cycling of elements or synthesis of specific organic molecules, but we have only rudimentary understanding of the forces that select for and promote blooms of these species. Mounting evidence suggests that the natural cycles of bloom variability are being altered on a global scale by human activities including the input of toxic contaminants and nutrients, manipulation of river flows, and translocation of species. This hypothesis will be a key component of our effort to understand global change at the land-sea interface. Pursuit of this hypothesis will require creative approaches for distinguishing natural and anthropogenic sources of phytoplankton population variability, as well as recognition that the modes of human disturbance of coastal bloom cycles operate interactively and cannot be studied as isolated processes.},

The conditions at the experimental site ranged from freshwater (minimum salinity 0.2) to mesohaline (maximum salinity 15.3). The experimental site was affected by an unexpected deposition of fluid mud during summer. Redundancy Analysis discriminated the experimental treatments along the first canonical ordination axis. The analysis also revealed an experimental gradient of increasing environmental stress, in which the minimal presence of organisms corresponded to treatments representing a high level of environmental stress. Sediment dynamics and saline fluctuations were the major factors that, together, determined the low macrofaunal abundance and species diversity at the experimental site. The most abundant macrofaunal species in this harsh environment were the polychaetes Hediste diversicolor and Streblospio shrubsolii. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Thirty years ago, Fausch (Can J Zool 62:441-451, 1984) proposed a simple model of optimal positions for drift-feeding salmonids in streams, whereby fish maximize their net energy intake ({NEI}) by selecting focal points in low water velocity near faster currents that deliver abundant drifting invertebrates. The theory was based on earlier observations in artificial and natural streams describing characteristics of salmonid positions and a conceptual model by Chapman (Am Nat 100:345-357, 1966). A test of this simple drift foraging model in a laboratory stream showed that the growth rate of juvenile trout and salmon increased with {NEI}, and that the rank of {NEI} at positions held by coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) correlated nearly perfectly with their rank in the dominance hierarchy. Fausch (1984) inferred from these findings that positions that optimize {NEI}, within the constraints of the dominance hierarchy, are the resource for which these stream salmonids compete. In turn, the model was used to test the effects of interspecific competition by coho salmon on the foraging positions held by brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta), and these results were used to infer potential effects of the introduced salmon on resident trout in Lake Michigan tributaries. Though the goals for this model were originally modest, it was tested in the field and further refined by Hughes and Dill (Can J Fish Aquat Sci 47:2039-2048, 1990) and others. During the last 20 years, the general theory has been incorporated into other models, which have been applied widely to analyze salmonid distribution and abundance in streams and rivers and used for management and restoration of habitat and flow regimes to benefit these fishes.},

	abstract = {Fish reproduction in floodplain ecosystems, based on relative abundance and total biomass of 0+ juveniles, was studied using the synchronic approach to typological analysis in conjunction with Point Abundance Sampling by modified electrofishing. In 3 different flood plains of the Upper Rhbne River, 1015 point samples yielding 4573 juveniles (0+) from 21 species were collected from 48 ecosystems of various geomorphological origin. The results demonstrate the lotic-to-lentic succession of floodplain ecosystems to be a series of non-sequential reproductive zones, with spawning conditions being reflected by the specific composition and guild structure of the {YOY} fish assemblages. The habitat diversity and the fish reproductive potential of floodplain ecosystems are strongly influenced by geomorphological origin and by past and present hydrological conditions. The {YOY} assemblages of autogenically driven ecosystems (usually of anastomose or meander origin) tend to differ both in composition and in quantity from those found in allogenically driven ecosystems (generally of braided origin). Ecosystems of intermediate character, and fish reproduction thereof, occur as the result of either ecosystem rejuvenation or senescence: autogenically driven ecosystems by allogenic mechanisms, or allogenically driven ecosystems by anthropic and/or autogenic mechanisms, respectively. Because of co-occurrence of ecosystems at similar and at different successional status, the flood plain as an entity is seen as ‘stable’ with respect to fish reproduction. Introduction.},

	abstract = {The upstream migration of adult anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin ({CRB}) has been dramatically altered and fish may be experiencing energetically costly delays at dams. To explore this notion, we estimated the energetic costs of migration and reproduction of Yakima River-bound spring Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha using a sequential analysis of their proximate composition (i.e., percent water, fat, protein, and ash). Tissues (muscle, viscera, and gonad) were sampled from fish near the start of their migration (Bonneville Dam), at a mid point (Roza Dam, 510km upstream from Bonneville Dam) and from fresh carcasses on the spawning grounds (about 100km above Roza Dam). At Bonneville Dam, the energy reserves of these fish were remarkably high, primarily due to the high percentage of fat in the muscle (18–20\%; energy content over 11 {kJ} g?1). The median travel time for fish from Bonneville to Roza Dam was 27 d and ranged from 18 to 42 d. Fish lost from 6 to 17\% of their energy density in muscle, depending on travel time. On average, fish taking a relatively long time for migration between dams used from 5 to 8\%more energy from the muscle than faster fish. From the time they passed Bonneville Damto death, these fish, depending on gender, used 95–99\% of their muscle and 73–86\% of their visceral lipid stores. Also, both sexes used about 32\% of their muscular and very little of their visceral protein stores. However, we were unable to relate energy use and reproductive success to migration history. Our results suggest a possible influence of the {CRB} hydroelectric system on adult salmonid energetics},

These fishes carry organic matter and marine-derived nutrient ({MDN}) subsidies across a vast landscape, often with profound influences on recipient ecosystem food web structure and function. In the Columbia River basin, century-long declines in the abundance of anadromous fish populations have focused attention on potential mitigation efforts to address {MDN} deficits. In this study, we evaluate components of the stream food web response (periphyton, macroinvertebrate, and fish) to pasteurized salmon carcass analog ({SCA}) treatments in 15 streams across the Columbia River basin. Periphyton standing crop, macroinvertebrate density, and salmonid fish growth rates and stomach fullness measures increased following the addition of {SCA}. We found no significant change in dissolved nutrient concentrations after treatment, suggesting that biological demand exceeded supply. Nitrogen stable isotope signatures confirmed trophic transfer from {SCA} to lower trophic levels but were noticeably weak in fish tissue samples despite our marked growth and stomach fullness measures. These data indicate that {SCA} has the potential to increase the productivity of nutrient-limited freshwater ecosystems and may provide a nutrient mitigation tool in ecosystems where {MDNs} are severely limited or unavailable.

	abstract = {Although nutrient supply often underlies long-term changes in aquatic primary production, other regulatory processes can be important. The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, a complex of tidal waterways forming the landward portion of the San Francisco Estuary, has ample nutrient supplies, enabling us to examine alternate regulatory mechanisms over a 21-yr period. Delta-wide primary productivity was reconstructed from historical water quality data for 1975-1995. Annual primary production averaged 70 g C m-2, but it varied by over a factor of five among years. At least four processes contributed to this variability: (1) invasion of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis led to a persistent decrease in phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) after 1986; (2) a long-term decline in total suspended solids-probably at least partly because of upstream dam construction-increased water transparency and phytoplankton growth rate; (3) river inflow, reflecting climate variability, affected biomass through fluctuations in flushing and growth rates through fluctuations in total suspended solids; and (4) an additional pathway manifesting as a long-term decline in winter phytoplankton biomass has been identified, but its genesis is uncertain. Overall, the Delta lost 43\% in annual primary production during the period. Given the evidence for food limitation of primary consumers, these findings provide a partial explanation for widespread Delta species declines over the past few decades. Turbid nutrient-rich systems such as the Delta may be inherently more variable than other tidal systems because certain compensatory processes are absent. Comparisons among systems, however, can be tenuous because conclusions about the magnitude and mechanisms of variability are dependent on length of data record.},

Often the health of freshwater ecosystems depends on maintaining and recovering hydrologic habitat connectivity, which includes structural components related to the physical landscape, functionality of flow dynamics, and an understanding of species habitat requirements for movement, reproduction, and survival. To advance our understanding of hydrologic habitat connectivity and benefits of habitat restoration alternatives we provide: (1) a review of recent perspectives on hydrologic connectivity, including quantitative methods; and (2) a modeling framework to quantify the effects of restoration on hydrologic habitat connectivity. We then illustrate this approach through a case study on lateral hydrologic habitat connectivity that results from channel restoration scenarios using scenarios with different historic and climate-change flows to restore fish floodplain habitat in a med-river, the San Joaquin River, California. Case study results show that in addition to the channel alterations, higher flows are required to recover significant flooded habitat area, especially given reductions in flows expected under climate change. These types of studies will help the planning for restoration of hydrologic habitat connectivity in med-rivers, a critical step for mediterranean species recovery.},

	abstract = {Fishes were sampled on the restored floodplain of the Cosumnes River in Central California in order to determine patterns of floodplain use. The floodplain was sampled for seven years (1998-2002, 2004-2005) during the winter-spring flooding season. The fishes fell into five groups: (1) floodplain spawners, (2) river spawners, (3) floodplain foragers, (4) floodplain pond fishes, and (5) inadvertent users. Eight of the 18 abundant species were natives, while the rest were aliens. There was a consistent pattern of floodplain use, modified by timing and extent of flooding. The first fishes to appear were floodplain foragers, inadvertent users, and juvenile Chinook salmon (river spawners). Next were floodplain spawners, principally Sacramento splittail and common carp. At the end of the season, in ponds of residual water, non-native annual fishes, mainly inland silverside and western mosquitofish, became abundant. Adult spawners left when inflow decreased; their juveniles persisted as long as flood pulses kept water levels up and temperatures low. Juvenile splittail and carp quickly grew large enough to dominate floodplain fish samples, along with smaller numbers of juvenile Sacramento sucker and pikeminnow (river spawners). Such juveniles left the Relatively few fishes that used the floodplain for spawning or rearing became stranded, except late season alien fishes. Most alien fishes had resident populations in adjacent river, sloughs, and ditches and were not dependent on the floodplain for persistence. This indicates that Central Valley floodplains managed to favor native fishes should have the following char- acteristics: (1) extensive early season flooding, (2) complete drainage by the end of the flooding season, (3) few areas with permanent water, (4) a mosaic of physical habitats, (5) regular annual flooding but with high variability in flood regime.},

	doi = {10.1023/A:1021090900341},
	abstract = {The Netherlands are a small, low-lying delta in W. Europe (42000 km2; 50°-54° N; 3°-8° E), mainly consisting of alluvial deposits from the North Sea and from the large rivers Rhine and Meuse. The country was 'created by man'. The conversion of natural aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems into drained agricultural land was a major cultural operation over the past 1000 years. Roughly 55\% of the country's surface area is still agricultural land. Some decades ago, The Netherlands' landscape was characterised by an armoured coastline and bridled estuaries, a drastically reduced area of saline and freshwater marshes, fully regulated rivers and streams, and numerous artificial lakes. The aquatic ecosystems beyond the influence of the large rivers, the Pleistocene raised bogs and moor lands, have almost been completely annihilated in the past. Acidification and eutrophication led to the deterioration of the remaining softwater lake vegetation. Last but not least, an artificial drainage system was constructed, leading to an unnatural water table all over the country, high in summer, low in winter. Only very recently, some 25 years ago, the tide has been turned and ecological rehabilitation and restoration of disturbed ecosystems are in full swing now, enhanced by the European Union policy to set aside agricultural land in the Netherlands in favour of the development of 'nature'. The state of the art of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecological restoration projects in the Netherlands is given. Starting from the conceptual basis of restoration ecology, the successes and failures of hundreds of restoration projects are given. Numerous successful projects are mentioned. In general, ecological restoration endeavours are greatly benefiting from progressive experience in the course of the years. Failures mainly occur by insufficient application of physical, chemical or ecological principles. The spontaneous colonisation by plants and animals, following habitat reconstruction, is preferred. But sometimes the re-introduction of keystone species (e.g. eelgrass; salmon; beaver) is necessary in case the potential habitats are isolated or fragmented, or when a seed bank is lacking, thus not allowing viable populations to develop. Re-introduction of traditional management techniques (e.g. mowing without fertilisation; low intensity grazing) is important to rehabilitate the semi-natural and cultural landscapes, so characteristic for the Netherlands. For aquatic ecosystems proper (estuaries, rivers, streams, larger lakes) the rule of thumb is that re-establishment of the abiotic habitat conditions is a pre-requisite for the return of the target species. This implies rehabilitation of former hydrological end geomorphological conditions, and an increase in spatial heterogeneity. The 'bottom-up' technique of lake restoration, viz. reduction in nutrient loadings, and removal of nutrient-rich organic sediment, is the preferred strategy. The 'top-down' approach of curing eutrophicated ecosystems, that is drastic reduction of fish stock, mainly bream, and introduction of carnivorous fish, may be considered as complementary. For semi-aquatic ecosystems (river-fed and rain-fed peat moors, brook valleys, coastal dune slacks) it also counts that the abiotic constraints should be lifted, but here the species-oriented conservation strategy, the enhancement of the recovery of characteristic plant and animal species, is mainly followed. An important pre-requisite for the rehabilitation of the original natural or semi-natural vegetation is the presence of viable seed bank. Restoration of salt-marsh vegetation has to deal with a short-lived persistent seed bank, which means that transport of seeds by water currents is important. Isolated softwater ecosystems may rely on the long-lived seeds of the aquatic macrophytes. The paper ends with some notes on the predictability of the outcome of ecological restoration measures and the societal position of restoration ecology as a science. Scientists hold different views on the predictability of restoration measures. A fact is that the predictability of ecosystem development increases, with increasing knowledge of the underlying environmental processes.},

	abstract = {The Thames Estuary, Greater London represents a particularly challenging application for broad-scale strategic analysis of flood risk. It needs a robust flood model and comprehensive risk analysis framework to support the design of London's long-term flood risk management strategy. Traditionally, flood inundation modelling and risk analysis have to be performed by dividing the entire region into smaller disconnected flood plains due to the restriction of model capability and limitation of computational power. This approach essentially neglects the interaction of flood waves between different sub-floodplains and overlooks the broad-scale effects on flood risk. This work aims to test the High-Performance Integrated hydrodynamic Modelling System ({HiPIMS}) developed at Newcastle University for high-resolution flood simulations over a very large domain, covering 1250 km2 of the flood-prone zones in the Thames Estuary, London, {UK}. This unified modelling strategy directly takes into account the broad-scale effects caused by localised interventions and disturbances, and hence support more comprehensive flood risk analysis and management. As part of the integrated simulation work, model calibration has been done to choose an appropriate value of Manning's roughness coefficient (n) through systematic numerical experiments at resolutions from 40m to 5m. Results are compared with the observed tidal water levels at eight gauging stations along the estuary. In the ongoing work, the calibrated model is being used to conduct further simulations to investigate the flood risk in the estuary as a result of climate change and sea level rise.},

The river has a typical Alpine flow, with the period of high flow and flooding occurring in the spring and summer months. Phytoplankton biomass was constrained by physical variables, mainly water discharge and associated variables directly linked to water fluxes. These factors acted negatively and synchronously by diluting phy- toplankton cells and worsening the light regime. Nutrient concentrations did not appear to limit phytoplankton growth. Compared to many other central European rivers, the very low maximum algal biomasses supported by River Adige (Chl a{\textbackslash}7 lgl-1) are due to the Alpine flow regime, which is characterised by higher flow during the warmer months, when conditions for algal develop- ment are more favourable. Hydrology and flow regime, along with the channelisation of the river, caused development of a simplified phytoplankton community, which was almost exclusively composed of diatoms. Moreover, these factors contributed significantly to the lack of ordered and cyclic temporal patterns in phytoplankton dynamics. In fact, the gradient of species composition showed a strong association with hydrological factors. If the scenarios predicting increase of atmospheric temperatures and decrease of atmospheric precipitations and water availability in the regions south of the Alps are realistic, algal biomasses may rise and be associated with an increase of groups other than diatoms.},

	abstract = {Floodplain restoration has been advocated as a means to restore several ecological services associated with floodplains: water quality improvement, fish rearing habitat, wildlife habitat, flood control, and groundwater recharge. A history of agricultural encroachment on the lower Cosumnes River has resulted in extensive channelization and levee construction. In fall 1998, an experimental floodplain was established by breaching a levee in order to restore the connection between the main channel and its historic floodplain. In this study, we examined how effective this newly restored floodplain was at processing nitrate ({NO}3-) before reentering the main channel downstream. Two methods were used to examine nitrate loss. In December 2001, we determined denitrification potentials of the floodplain soils before seasonal flooding inundated the floodplain. Next, we conducted a series of field soil column (mesocosm) experiments from March to June 2002 to study {NO}3--N loss from the overlying water in both sandy and clayey soils and at three levels of {NO}3--N (ambient, +1 mg N l(-1), +5 mg N l(-1)). In addition, we examined {NO}3--N loss from mesocosms with water only to determine if loss was related primarily to soil or water column processes. Denitrification potentials were highly variable ranging from 1.6 to 769 ng N2O-N cm(-3) h(-1). In addition, the denitrification potential was highly correlated with the amount of bioavailable carbon indicating that carbon was a limiting factor for denitrification. Nitrate-N loss rates from mesocosms ranged from 2.9 to 21.0 mu g N l(-1) h(-1) over all treatments and all 3 months examined. Significant loss of {NO}3--N (60-93\%) from the water only treatment only occurred in June when warmer temperatures and solar radiation most likely increased {NO}3--N uptake by phytoplankton. When scaled up, potential {NO}3--N loss from the restored floodplain represented 0.6-4.4\% of the annual N load from the Lower Cosumnes River during a typical wet year and similar to 24\% during a dry year. During dry water years, the effectiveness of the floodplain for reducing nitrate is limited by the amount of N supplied to the floodplain. Results from this study suggest that restored floodplains can be an effective {NO}3- sink.},

	abstract = {Widespread loss and degradation of riverine habitats due to dams, diversions, levees, and human development have led to an increase in river habitat enhancement projects in recent decades. These projects typically focus on improving either terrestrial (e.g., riparian vegetation) or aquatic (e.g., fish spawning and rearing) habitats, and do not commonly address the relationship between the two systems. However, there is abundant evidence that fundamental linkages exist between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and anthropogenic impacts such as urban expansion, agricultural activities, and river impoundment can synergistically degrade both systems. This study examines the effects of adult and juvenile salmonid habitat restoration on recruitment, density, and composition of riparian vegetation in an area heavily impacted by mining and flow regulation. For a year following in-channel coarse sediment placement and floodplain construction in an area previously covered with coarse mine tailings, we compared the abundance, richness and diversity of vegetation across four treatments: the newly constructed floodplain, isolated mine tailings, mine tailings near an access road, and a remnant riparian area that was less impacted by mining. Richness and diversity were higher in the floodplain than in any of the other treatments; we identified a total of 15 plant families in the floodplain treatments, as compared to three to five families in the other treatments. We observed significant differences in plant assemblage composition between treatments, with higher richness of primarily obligate or facultative wetland plant taxa in the floodplain treatment. This study demonstrates that restoring hydrological linkages between aquatic and terrestrial habitats, and redistribution of sediment size classes altered by mining, can create conditions that promote rapid wetland plant colonization, enhancing biodiversity and improving ecosystem function.},

From a flood control standpoint, the 24,000 ha leveed floodplain has been exceptionally successful based on its ability to convey up to 80\% of the flow of the Sacramento River basin during high water events. Agricultural lands and seasonal and permanent wetlands within the bypass provide key habitat for waterfowl migrating through the Pacific Flyway. Our field studies demonstrate that the bypass seasonally supports 42 fish species, 15 of which are native. The floodplain appears to be particularly valuable spawning and rearing habitat for the splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus), a federally-listed cyprinid, and for young chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), which use the Yolo Bypass as a nursery area. The system may also be an important source to the downstream food web of the San Francisco Estuary as a result of enhanced production of phytoplankton and detrital material. These results suggest that alternative flood control systems can be designed without eliminating floodplain function and processes, key goals of the 1996 Draft {AFS} Floodplain Management Position Statement.},

In response to the pelagic fish collapse, an ambitious multi-hyphen;agency research team has been working since 2005 to evaluate the causes of the decline, which likely include a combination of factors: stock-recruitment effects, a decline in habitat quality, increased mortality rates, and reduced food availability due to invasive species.},

En revanche, la modification de la structure de la communauté de poissons après l’évènement de connexion naturel était beaucoup plus importante que celle attribuable à la variabilité intersaisonnière et interannuelle de fond en situation de déconnexion. La structure de la population de barbues n’a changé de manière significative qu’après la crue naturelle. Si cette crue naturelle a entraîné une augmentation des taux de population de divers poissons indigènes, elle s’est également traduite par une augmentation du taux de population des carpes, une espèce parasite non indigène. Il se pourrait que, pour avoir une incidence positive sur la biodiversité indigène, les débits environnementaux dans les plaines inondables doivent simuler les propriétés des crues naturelles. L’un des défis que cela présente consiste à gérer la connectivité hydrologique dans la plaine inondable d’une manière qui profite plus aux espèces indigènes qu’aux espèces introduites.},

	abstract = {Salt marshes are fringe ecosystems susceptible to physico-chemical variations and therefore ecophysiological studies are needed to predict responses to climate change. For such studies, selection of plant species across a tidal range is critical, as species responses could be used as a proxy for that of the tidal range. These responses would then inform management options for salt marshes. The responses of Triglochin buchenaui, Bassia diffusa and Limonium linifolium to inundation and salinity were studied in an experiment simulating different conditions. Results showed that the lower intertidal plant T. buchenaui would survive three months of submergence through a suite of quiescence responses but that the upper intertidal plants L. linifolium and B. diffusa would not. Optimum elongation growth occurred in tidal conditions for T. buchenaui and B. diffusa at 0 and 18 ppt respectively, and decreased with increasing salinity. The results show that in permanently open South African estuaries, a landward migration of salt marsh will be possible under predicted conditions, if coastal squeeze is limited and the rate of landward recruitment is on par with sea level rise. In temporarily open/closed estuaries, reduced freshwater inflow will result in die back of salt marsh vegetation due to mouth closure, an increase in water level and sensitivity to prolonged submergence. Reduced salt marsh growth would occur when low freshwater inflow coupled with increased abstraction and drought result in low water levels and high sediment salinity. Overall, increased stress under predicted conditions would reduce species diversity in an already species poor estuarine ecosystem. The results suggest the need for reactive management options such as assisted regeneration and marsh drenching to be incorporated into future integrated salt marsh management plans for South Africa.},

	abstract = {Salmonid stocks have been depleted quantitatively and qualitatively, and much of their freshwater habitat has been destroyed. Extensive enhancement programs through hatchery rearing have not restored these stocks, largely because their evolutionary heritage and the discrete stock structure that it has engendered are poorly understood. Salmonids show a wide range of life-styles and high phenotypic plasticity. The simplest are those of pink salmon, Oncorhynchus gorbuscha, of which some populations spawn in brackish tidal waters and never use fresh water, and the most complex those of steelhead trout O. mykiss, which exhibits more than 30 life-history types, from anadromous to landlocked. Between these two extremes, life-styles range from those with some elements emancipated from the sea through some that complete their life cycles wholly within fresh water. Successful enhancement of salmonid stocks requires an understanding of the nature of this flexibility and of the controls over maturation that determine the life-cycle pattern that individuals will adopt. Hence, understanding fish life histories depends on understanding the control of fish reproduction. Maintaining this developmental diversity in rehabilitation of depleted populations depends on breeding programs designed to maintain genetic continuity, creation of the appropriate range of environmental opportunities during early rearing, and conservation of a sufficiently diverse freshwater habitat.},

	abstract = {Physical characteristics of riverine habitats, such as large wood abundance, pool geometry and abundance, riparian vegetation cover, and surface flow conditions, have traditionally been thought to constrain fish production in these ecosystems. Conversely, the role of food resources (quantity and quality) in controlling fish production has received far less attention and consideration, though they can also be key productivity drivers. Traditional freshwater food web illustrations have typically conveyed the notion that most fish food is produced within the local aquatic habitat itself, but the concepts and model we synthesize in this article show that most fish food comes from external or very distant sources?including subsidies from marine systems borne from adult returns of anadromous fishes, from fishless headwater tributaries that transport prey to downstream fish, and from adjacent streamside vegetation and associated habitats. The model we propose further illustrates how key trophic pathways and food sources vary through time and space throughout watersheds. Insights into how food supplies affect fishes can help guide how we view riverine ecosystems, their structure and function, their interactions with marine and terrestrial systems, and how we manage natural resources, including fish, riparian habitats, and forests. las características físicas de los hábitats fluviales, tales como abundancia de madera, geometría y abundancia de cuerpos de agua, cobertura de vegetación riparia y condiciones de flujo superficial han sido comúnmente consideradas como determinantes de la producción de peces en este tipo de ecosistemas. Alternativamente, el papel del suministro alimenticio (calidad y cantidad) en el control de la producción de peces ha recibido mucha menos atención y consideración pese a que también puede ser un elemento clave en cuanto al control de la productividad. Las clásicas ilustraciones de redes alimenticias de ambientes de agua dulce han dado la impresión de que la mayor parte del alimento de los peces se produce dentro del propio hábitat acuático local, pero los conceptos y el modelo que se presentan en este artículo muestran que gran parte del alimento de los peces proviene de fuentes externas o muy distantes ?incluyendo subsidios por parte de los sistemas marinos como el retorno de adultos de peces anádromos, tributarios paralelos que transportan las presas hacia los peces que habitan río abajo, vegetación ribereña y hábitats asociados. El modelo que se propone, además, explica cómo las vías tróficas clave y los suministros alimenticios, varían a través del tiempo y del espacio entre cuencas. El conocimiento de cómo los suministros de alimento afectan a los peces, puede ayudar a mejorar la forma en la que se estudian los ecosistemas fluviales, a entender su estructura y función, sus interacciones con sistemas marinos y terrestres y a optimizar el manejo de los recursos naturales, incluyendo peces, hábitats riparios y forestales.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the spatial variability in the social vulnerability of residents to potential levee failures in the Sacramento Delta region. To determine the likely flood exposure, levees of concern to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and California's Department of Water Resources were mapped. The {HAZUS}-{MH} loss estimation software and 100-year protection standard were used to hypothetically breach levees to determine a coarse approximation of the level and spatial extent of inundation. To assess the differential social consequences of such an event, a social vulnerability index was computed at the census tract level for San Joaquin, Sacramento, and Yolo counties following the vulnerability metrics developed by Cutter et al. in 2003. When integrated with the flood exposure data, there is a clustering of high social vulnerability zones within high risk flood areas. While the spatial pattern is not uniform throughout the tricounty area, these pockets of high vulnerability largely driven by social factors warrant management concern about the disproportionate impact of catastrophic levee failures on these populations and the level of local, state, and federal preparedness to cope with such an event.},

	abstract = {Transport time scales are common metrics of the strength of transport processes. Water age is the time elapsed since water from a specific source has entered a study area. An observational method to estimate water age relies on the progressive concentration of the heavier isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in water that occurs during evaporation. The isotopic composition is used to derive the fraction of water evaporated, and then translated into a transport time scale by applying assumptions of representative water depth and evaporation rate. Water age can also be estimated by a hydrodynamic model using tracer transport equations. Water age calculated by each approach is compared in the Cache Slough Complex, located in the northern San Francisco Estuary, during summer conditions in which this region receives minimal direct freshwater inflow. The model's representation of tidal dispersion of Sacramento River water into this backwater region is evaluated. In order to compare directly to isotopic estimates of the fraction of water evaporated ("fractional evaporation") in addition to age, a hydrodynamic model-based property tracking approach analogous to the water age estimation approach is proposed. The age and fractional evaporation model results are analyzed to evaluate assumptions applied in the field-based age estimates. The generally good correspondence between the water age results from both approaches provides confidence in applying the modeling approach to predict age through broader spatial and temporal scales than are practical to assess using the field method, and discrepancies between the two methods suggest aspects of both approaches that may be improved. Model skill in predicting water age is compared to skill in predicting salinity. Compared to water age, salinity observations are shown to be a less useful diagnostic of transport in this low salinity region in which salt inputs are poorly constrained.},

	volume = {64},
	abstract = {he trophic interaction between zooplankton and bacteria was examined to determine how this food web linkage varied with resource abundance and consumer species and age. Life table experiments and feeding-rate measurements were conducted with two species of co-occurring cladoc- erans, Daphnia parvula and Ceriodaphnia lacustris. Cohorts of these cladocerans were followed from birth to death and fed either no food (particle-free lake water), natural bacteria only (I -m filtrate of lake water), whole lake water, or lake water enriched with 104 cells/{mL} of the green algae Chlam- ydomonas reinhardi. By comparing cohorts grown in lake water to those grown in enriched lake water, we also determined the extent of food limitation in the natural populations of these two potentially competitive species. As bacterial densities increased from winter through summer, the ability of the larger species, Daphnia parvula, to grow and reproduce on the bacterial fraction also increased. Bacteria, however, were never a primary resource for Daphnia. The rate of population increase (r) was always negative even at the highest in situ concentrations of bacteria (1-2 x 10' cells/{mL}). The smaller species, Ceriodaphnia lacustris, was able to increase (r = 0.070) on bacteria alone at lower bacterial concentrations (5 x 106 cells/{mL}). Ceriodaphnia juveniles had the highest age-specific survival rates (lx) on bacteria. The improved survivorship was not due to higher feeding rates on bacteria by Ceriodaphnia. Neither age nor species when adjusted for the effect of body mass accounted for a significant portion of the variance in filtering rates on bacteria. Natural field food concentrations were always suboptimal, based on comparisons of growth rates, reproduction, and r values for the cohorts grown in lake water vs. enriched lake water. Rates of increase (r), however, were always substantially greater than zero in the lake water treatment for both species, indicating that food is not the primary factor that causes seasonal declines of the cladoceran populations in this lake. These results demonstrate a differential utilization efficiency of the smallest resource size-classes by these two zooplankton species. The experiments also indicate the dynamic nature of the trophic interaction between zooplankton and bacteria. The strength of this food web pathway varies with both the seasonal abundance of bacteria and the age, size, and type of zooplankton consumer.},

In a recent project marking a new direction for spawning habitat rehabilitation, 2450 m3 of gravel and several boulders were used to craft bars and chutes. To improve the design of future projects, a test was carried out in which a commercial modelling package was used to design and evaluate alternative gravel configurations in relation to the actual pre- and post-project configurations. Tested scenarios included alternate bars, central braid, a combination of alternate bars and a braid, and a flat riffle with uniformly spaced boulders. All runs were compared for their spawning habitat value and for susceptibility to erosion. The flat riffle scenario produced the most total, high, and medium quality habitat, but would yield little habitat under flows deviating from the design discharge. Bar and braid scenarios were highly gravel efficient, with nearly 1 m2 of habitat per 1 m3 of gravel added, and yielded large contiguous high quality habitat patches that were superior to the actual design. At near bankfull flow, negligible sediment entrainment was predicted for any scenario. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

A preference analysis indicated that subyearlings did not eat food items in proportion to food availability; they preferred small zooplankters least and terrestrial insects most. Rank in preference of food items was correlated positively with rank in size of available food items, but not with rank in number in the diet. Only rank in number of prey items available in the habitat was consistently correlated with rank in number in the diet. The shift in diet to Daphnia spp. and terrestrial insects in the reservoir was due primarily to the high availability of those food items and the low availability of others. The switch to food items abundant in reservoirs enabled subyearling chinook salmon to use the reservoirs as nursery areas. However, the use of Daphnia spp. may entail a higher foraging cost per energy unit gained because of the small size of the prey.},

	abstract = {1. Increasingly, river managers are turning from hard engineering solutions to ecologically based restoration activities in order to improve degraded waterways. River restoration projects aim to maintain or increase ecosystem goods and services while protecting downstream and coastal ecosystems. There is growing interest in applying river restoration techniques to solve environmental problems, yet little agreement exists on what constitutes a successful river restoration effort. 2. We propose five criteria for measuring success, with emphasis on an ecological perspective. First, the design of an ecological river restoration project should be based on a specified guiding image of a more dynamic, healthy river that could exist at the site. Secondly, the river's ecological condition must be measurably improved. Thirdly, the river system must be more self-sustaining and resilient to external perturbations so that only minimal follow-up maintenance is needed. Fourthly, during the construction phase, no lasting harm should be inflicted on the ecosystem. Fifthly, both pre- and post- assessment must be completed and data made publicly available. 3. Determining if these five criteria have been met for a particular project requires development of an assessment protocol. We suggest standards of evaluation for each of the five criteria and provide examples of suitable indicators. 4. Synthesis and applications. Billions of dollars are currently spent restoring streams and rivers, yet to date there are no agreed upon standards for what constitutes ecologically beneficial stream and river restoration. We propose five criteria that must be met for a river restoration project to be considered ecologically successful. It is critical that the broad restoration community, including funding agencies, practitioners and citizen restoration groups, adopt criteria for defining and assessing ecological success in restoration. Standards are needed because progress in the science and practice of river restoration has been hampered by the lack of agreed upon criteria for judging ecological success. Without well-accepted criteria that are ultimately supported by funding and implementing agencies, there is little incentive for practitioners to assess and report restoration outcomes. Improving methods and weighing the ecological benefits of various restoration approaches require organized national-level reporting systems. © 2005 British Ecological Society.},

River restoration projects have the potential to influence many of the societal functions (e.g., flood control, water quality) that rivers provide, yet most projects fail to consider this in a comprehensive manner. Most river restoration projects also fail to take into account opportunities for revitalization of large-scale river processes, focusing instead on opportunities presented at individual parcels. In an effort to avoid these pitfalls while planning restoration of the Sacramento River, we conducted a set of coordinated studies to evaluate societal impacts of alternative restoration actions over a large geographic area. Our studies were designed to identify restoration actions that offer benefits to both society and the ecosystem and to meet the information needs of agency planning teams focusing on the area. We worked with local partners and public stakeholders to design and implement studies that assessed the effects of alternative restoration actions on flooding and erosion patterns, socioeconomics, cultural resources, and public access and recreation. We found that by explicitly and scientifically melding societal and ecosystem perspectives, it was possible to identify restoration actions that simultaneously improve both ecosystem health and the services (e.g., flood protection and recreation) that the Sacramento River and its floodplain provide to people. Further, we found that by directly engaging with local stakeholders to formulate, implement, and interpret the studies, we were able to develop a high level of trust that ultimately translated into widespread support for the project. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

Using model results, we compare bulk formula approaches—the tidal prism method, freshwater fraction method, and a relatively new estuarine timescale calculation method based on the total exchange flow ({TEF})—to directly calculated timescales from particle tracking in order to assess the utility of the bulk formula timescales. All of the timescales calculated had similar magnitudes during high river discharge but varied significantly at low discharge and had different dependences on tidal amplitude. Even in the application of a single estuary-averaged timescale, we did not find that any of the bulk timescales described the estuary over a realistic range of tidal and river discharge forcing. During high discharge, the Yaquina Bay timescale is on the order of 2–5 tidal cycles based on the particle tracking analysis, but during low discharge, the turnover time varies across methods and spatial considerations appear to be more important.},

Barnegat Bay-Little Egg Harbor ({BB}-{LEH}), New Jersey, is a lagoonal back-barrier estuary that is subject to anthropogenic pressures including nutrient loading, eutrophication, and subsequent declines in water quality. A combination of hydrodynamic and particle tracking modeling was used to identify the mechanisms controlling flushing, residence time, and spatial variability of particle retention. The models demonstrated a pronounced northward subtidal flow from Little Egg Inlet in the south to Pt. Pleasant Canal in the north due to frictional effects in the inlets, leading to better flushing of the southern half of the estuary and particle retention in the northern estuary. Mean residence time for {BB}-{LEH} was 13 days but spatial variability was between ∼0 and 30 days depending on the initial particle location. Mean residence time with tidal forcing alone was 24 days (spatial variability between ∼0 and 50 days); the tides were relatively inefficient in flushing the northern end of the Bay. Scenarios with successive exclusion of physical processes from the models revealed that meteorological and remote offshore forcing were stronger drivers of exchange than riverine inflow. Investigations of water quality and eutrophication should take into account spatial variability in hydrodynamics and residence time in order to better quantify the roles of nutrient loading, production, and flushing.},

The spatial structure and temporal amplitudes of an empirical orthogonal function analysis of the pressure measurements suggest the dominant low-frequency variability is modal. Incoming and outgoing linear flux estimates also support partially standing modes on the reef flat during energetic events. A cross-covariance analysis suggests that breakpoint forcing excites these partially standing modes, similar to previous findings at other steep reefs. The dynamics of Symonds et al. (1982) with damping are applied to a step reef, with forcing obtained by extending a point break model of Vetter et al. (2010) for breaking wave setup to the low-frequency band using the shoaled envelope of the incident free surface elevation. A one parameter, linear analytical model for the reef flat free surface elevation is presented, which describes between 75\% and 97\% of the variance of the observed low-frequency shoreline significant wave height for all reefs considered over a range of conditions. The linear model contains a single dimensionless parameter that is the ratio of the inertial to dissipative time scales, and the observations from this study exhibit more low-frequency variability when the dissipative time scale is greater than the inertial time scale for the steep reefs considered.},

We investigated the spatial variability of stream isotopes and water ages to infer dominant flow paths in a {\textasciitilde}10-km2 nested catchment in a disturbed, predominantly agricultural environment in Scotland. We collected long-term ({\textgreater}5 years) stable isotope data of precipitation, artificial drainage, and four streams with varying soil and land use types in their catchment areas. Using a gamma model, Mean Transit Times ({MTTs}) were then estimated in order to understand the spatial variability of controls on water ages. Despite contrasting catchment characteristics, we found that {MTTs} in the streams were generally very similar and short ({\textless}1 year). {MTTs} of water in artificial drains were even shorter, ranging between 1 to 10 months for a typical field drain and {\textless}0.5 to 1 month for a country road drain. At the catchment scale, lack of heterogeneity in the response could be explained by the extensive artificial surface and subsurface drainage, “short-circuiting” younger water to the streams during storms. Under such conditions, additional intense disturbance associated with highway construction during the study period had no major effect on the stream isotope dynamics. Supplementary short-term ({\textasciitilde}14 months) sampling of mobile soil water in dominant soil-land use units also revealed that agricultural practices (ploughing of poorly draining soils and soil compaction due to grazing on freely draining soils) resulted in subtle {MTT} variations in soil water in the upper profile. Overall, the isotope dynamics and inferred {MTTs} suggest that the evolution of stream water ages in such a complex human-influenced environment are largely related to near-surface soil processes and the dominant soil management practices. This has direct implications for understanding and managing flood risk and contaminant transport in such environments.},

Inundation of floodplains by regional water, that is, overbank flow from the main river channel, and local water, that is, groundwater, hyporheic water, local tributary water, and direct precipitation onto the floodplain, is such that some rivers inundate dry floodplains, while other rivers inundate fully saturated floodplains. Remote sensing and field data from the large rivers Missouri, Mississippi, Amazon, Ob'-Irtysh, Taquari, and Altamaha show a variety of water types on inundated floodplains, including areas of mixing of river and local water defined as the 'perirheic zone.' For the rivers examined here, only the Missouri River flooded its entire valley with sediment-rich river water. Therefore the floodplains of these large rivers from the Arctic to the Amazon are only partially inundated with river water during floods and the corresponding perirheic zones may encompass a significant floodplain ecotone.},

	abstract = {The structure and function of estuarine food webs change in response to both natural and anthropogenic stresses. The construction of quantitative food webs and their analysis by means of Ecological Network Analysis provides outputs that have been used in many studies to assess system development, stress, robustness, resilience and maturity. Here we attempt to relate to the physical characteristics of the environment, ecosystem indices derived from Ecological Network Analysis. Ten models of food webs were gathered, across a selection of soft-bottom estuaries representative of a large morphological and hydrodynamic diversity, from wave-dominated to mixed energy tide-dominated systems. The selection allowed the comparison of their derived Ecological Network Analysis indices, because of similarities of accuracy in the representation of detritus and bacteria, and because models took into account all trophic levels up to top-predators. In order to obtain comparable physical characteristics, global models were used for a homogeneous description of tide and tidal prisms. Spearman correlations, hierarchical ascendant clustering and Redundancy Analysis were applied to examine the relationship between Ecological Network Analysis indices and physical characteristics. The set of four physical variables selected (catchment area, tidal range at neap tide, index of tide-wave domination and latitude in absolute value) explained 67\% of the structure of the Ecological Network Analysis indices. This implies that the physical forcing related to climate, hydrodynamics and morphology is essential for determining the ecological emergent properties of the food web. In the European policy context of determining the 'good ecological status' of coastal ecosystems, it implies that the use of Ecological Network Analysis indices for basing the determination of operational indicators should be done, taking into account this context of a strong influence of physical factors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

While the impact of a sudden salinity increase on M. aeruginosa physiology has been studied, less is known about the mechanisms involved in salt tolerance after acclimation. This study aims to compare the physiological responses of two strains of M. aeruginosa ({PCC} 7820 and {PCC} 7806), which were isolated from contrasted environments, to increasing salinities. After acclimation, growth and {MC} production rates were determined and metabolomic analyses were conducted. For both strains, salinity decreased the biovolume, growth, and {MC} production rates and induced the accumulation of polyunsaturated lipids identified as monogalactosyldiacylglycerol. The distinct salt tolerances (7.5 and 16.9) obtained between the freshwater ({PCC} 7820) and the brackish-water ({PCC} 7806) strains suggested different strategies to cope with the osmotic pressure, as revealed by targeted and untargeted metabolomic analyses. An accumulation of trehalose as the main compatible solute was obtained in the freshwater strain, while sucrose was mainly accumulated in the brackish one. Moreover, distinct levels of glycine betaine and proline accumulation were noted. Altogether, metabolomic analysis illustrated a strain-specific response to salt tolerance, involving compatible solute production.},

A quarter of a century ago, the state of this understanding was described by the verbal plankton ecology group ({PEG}) model. It emphasized the role of physical factors, grazing and nutrient limitation for phytoplankton, and the role of food limitation and fish predation for zooplankton. Although originally targeted at lake ecosystems, it was also adopted by marine plankton ecologists. Since then, a suite of ecological interactions previously underestimated in importance have become research foci: overwintering of key organisms, the microbial food web, parasitism, and food quality as a limiting factor and an extended role of higher order predators. A review of the impact of these novel interactions on plankton seasonal succession reveals limited effects on gross seasonal biomass patterns, but strong effects on species replacements. © 2012 by Annual Reviews.

	abstract = {Floodplain systems along rivers are influenced by the hydrological regime of the river to an extent which depends on the degree of connectivity. As a result, the age of water within the system varies widely. Zooplankton development is restricted to areas and periods of higher water age and thus the role of zooplankton in planktonic carbon flow is strongly influenced by the hydrological dynamics. In 1997 and 1998 the plankton community was examined in the floodplain system along the River Danube, at two sections differing in connectivity to the main river. Zooplankton grazing rates and consumption were calculated, using filtration rates from the literature, based on qualitative and quantitative phyto- and zooplankton data. A succession in grazing dominance from rotifers to cladocerans and copepods was found with increasing water age. Maximal carbon flow and impact on algae by grazing rates of {\textgreater}100\% (mean 40.5\%) were observed at intermediate connectivity, when zooplankton biomass peaked. Mean grazing impact at high connectivity amounted to 2.5\%, and at low connectivity 8.8\%, of the total phytoplankton biomass. The main grazers were Synchaeta spp., Polyarthra spp., and the small cladoceran, Bosmina longirostris. Herbivory dominated carbon transfer in the planktonic food webs during dynamic conditions. When conditions are stable, additional food pathways (bacterivory, predation,) increase in significance and result in an increased biotic control.},

	abstract = {Although floodplains are known to be tightly controlled by the flood cycle, we know comparatively little about how flooding influences predators and their consumption of secondary production, particularly in highly seasonal floodplains typical of Mediterranean climates. In this study, we investigate how the seasonal dynamics of a central California floodplain influence the timing and magnitude of fish predation and the abundance and composition of invertebrates. For 3 years (2000-2002), we compared changes in abundances and size distributions of invertebrates through the flood season (January-June) with seasonal changes in the abundance of larval and juvenile fishes. Using diet analysis of fishes and manipulative feeding experiments with fishes in field enclosures, we link specific changes in invertebrate populations directly to feeding preferences of seasonally abundant fish. Early in the flood season prior to March, we found little influence of fish predation, consistent with the near absence of larval and juvenile fishes during this period. Coinciding with the midseason increase in the abundance of larval and juvenile fishes in April, we found significant declines in zooplankton abundance as well as declines in the size of zooplankton consistent with fish feeding preferences. Our results were consistent with results from feeding enclosure experiments that showed that fish rapidly depressed populations of larger cladocerans with much less effect on smaller cladocerans and calanoid copepods. At the end of the flood season, zooplankton abundances rapidly increased, consistent with a switch in the feeding of juvenile fish to aquatic insects and subsequent fish mortality. We also found that zooplankton biomass on the floodplain reached a maximum 2-3 weeks after disconnection with the river. We suggest that floodplain restoration in this region should consider management strategies that would ensure repeated flooding every 2-3 weeks during periods that would best match the peaks in abundance of native fishes. © Springer 2006.},

	abstract = {Although the Po river is the most important fluvial system of Northern Italy, the systematic geochemical and isotopic investigations of its water are rare and were never reported for the whole basin. The present contribution aims to fill this knowledge gap, reporting a comprehensive data set including oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes as well as major and trace element concentration of dissolved species for 54 Po river water samples, mainly collected in different hydrological conditions (peak discharge in April, drought in August) at increasing distance from the source, i.e., from the upper part of the catchment to the terminal (deltaic) part of the river at the confluence with the Adriatic Sea. The isotopic compositions demonstrate that the predominant part of the runoff derives from the Alpine sector of the catchment through important tributaries such as the Dora Baltea, Ticino, Adda, and Tanaro rivers, whereas the contribution from the Apennines tributaries is less important. The geochemical and isotopic compositions show that the Po river water attains a homogeneous composition at ca. 100 km from the source. The average composition is characterized by δ18O −9.8 ‰, δD −66.2 ‰, total dissolved solid ({TDS}) 268 mg/L, and chloride 17 mg/L and by a general Ca–{HCO}3 hydrochemical facies, which is maintained for most of the river stream, only varying in the terminal part where the river is diverted in a complex deltaic system affected by more significant evaporation and mixing with saline water evidenced by higher {TDS} and chloride content (up to 8198 and 4197 mg/L, respectively). Geochemical and isotopic maps have been drawn to visualize spatial gradients, which reflect the evolution of the river water composition at progressive distance from the source; more detailed maps were focused on the deltaic part in order to visualize the processes occurring in the transitional zone toward the Adriatic Sea. The data also highlight anthropogenic contributions, mainly represented by significant concentrations of nitrate (average 8 mg/L) and possibly arsenic (average 12 μg/L). These data allow the calculation of geochemical fluxes transferred from the river to the sea, and generally, they contribute to the definition of a “hydro-archive” which is useful to highlight ongoing variations in the related ecosystems.},

	abstract = {In this study, we investigate the surface flow time of rise in response to rainfall and snowmelt events at different spatial scales and the main sources originating channel runoff and spring water in a steep nested headwater catchment (Rio Vauz, Italian Dolomites), characterized by a marked elevation gradient. We monitored precipitation at different elevations and measured water stage/streamflow at the outlet of two rocky subcatchments of the same size, representative of the upper part of the catchment dominated by outcropping bedrock, at the outlet of a soil-mantled and vegetated subcatchment of similar size but different morphology, and at the outlet of the main catchment. Hydrometric data are coupled with stable isotopes and electrical conductivity sampled from different water sources during five years, and used as tracers in end-member mixing analysis, application of two component mixing models and analysis of the slope of the dual-isotope regression line. Results reveal that times of rise are slightly shorter for the two rocky subcatchments, particularly for snowmelt and mixed rainfall/snowmelt events, compared to the soil-mantled catchment and the entire Rio Vauz Catchment. The highly-variable tracer signature of the different water sources reflects the geomorphological and geological complexity of the study area. The principal end-members for channel runoff and spring water are identified in rainfall and snowmelt, which are the dominant water sources in the rocky upper part of the study catchment, and soil water and shallow groundwater, which play a relevant role in originating baseflow and spring water in the soil-mantled and vegetated lower part of the catchment. Particularly, snowmelt contributes up to 64 ± 8\% to spring water in the concave upper parts of the catchment and up to 62 ± 11\% to channel runoff in the lower part of the catchment. These results offer new experimental evidences on how Dolomitic catchments capture and store rain water and meltwater, releasing it through a complex network of surface and subsurface flow pathways, and allow for the construction of a preliminary conceptual model on water transmission in snowmelt-dominated catchments featuring marked elevation gradients.},

We hypothesized that floodplain contribution to fish diet would be maximal during the early growing period following the seasonal flood and at sites located closest to the floodplain. Carbon stable isotope ratios (δ13C) of invertebrates and 35 fish species were analyzed at the beginning and at the end of two growing seasons, at increasing distances from the floodplain. Floodplain contribution, in the form of exported aquatic invertebrates, was estimated at the fish community (littoral versus main river), species and individual fish level, using a stable isotopic mixing model and a linear mixed model selection. As hypothesized, fish captured in the early part of the growing season near the floodplain benefitted from the largest floodplain contribution, which decreased during the late growing season. In addition, floodplain contribution differed among fish species, being higher in small or immature littoral species (northern pike, yellow perch, blackchin and golden shiners) than for larger taxa inhabiting the main river channel (shorthead redhorse, white sucker and channel catfish). Our study revealed that floodplain production during the early growing season represents a key food resource to a large portion of the riverine food web, thus highlighting the essential role of the floodplain in human-altered temperate rivers.},

	abstract = {The productivity of Fraser River sockeye salmon has declined in recent years, with 2019 being the lowest return on record. The cause of the decline is still not fully understood; however, bottom-up drivers and trophic interactions during the early marine migration are considered to be important contributing factors. {McKinnell} et al. (Fisheries Oceanography, 23, 2014 and 322) developed a “trophic gauntlet hypothesis,” proposing that low biological productivity leads to an energy deficit from poor foraging opportunities in migrating salmon. When combined with poor foraging conditions in typically productive waters elsewhere on the migration, low marine survival may result. Our study examined prey availability and stomach fullness of juvenile sockeye salmon along the 120 km stretch of the coastal migration through the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait to determine whether this section of the migration is indeed food limited. We observed low stomach fullness throughout tidally mixed waters, providing empirical support for the trophic gauntlet hypothesis. Zooplankton abundance was high in these regions so it appeared that unfavourably small prey size may have been the cause of low foraging success. We also observed foraging hotspots at both ends of the gauntlet, indicating that such areas may be key feeding grounds for migratory salmon.},

	abstract = {Glaciers are shrinking due to global warming, resulting in a diminishing contribution of ice and snowmelt to headwaters and subsequent consequences to freshwater ecosystems. Within this context, we tested whether water-stable isotopes are spatio-temporal tracers of (i) water in high altitude periglacial environments, being the isotopic signature of surface water inherited from the snow/icemelt, groundwater, and rainfall; and (ii) regional (year-specific) meteorological conditions, being the isotopic signature of precipitations affected by air temperature, humidity and aqueous vapour origin, ascribing stable isotopes to the list of "essential climate variables" ({ECVs}). To this end, we investigated the ionic and isotopic composition (δ18O and δ2H) of six high-altitude streams and one pond in the Italian Alps (Noce and Sarca basins) during the ablation season in 2018. Differences between habitat types (pond, kryal, rhithral, krenal) were detected. More negative values of δ18O and δ2H were recorded in the kryal and glacio-rhithral sites, dominated by ice and snowmelt, in early summer. Less negative values were recorded in these sites in late summer, as well as in the krenal sites, which were dominated by groundwater and rainfall inputs. The isotopic results also show that the complex alpine orography influences air masses and moisture, ultimately resulting in isotopic differences in the precipitations of neighboring but distinct catchments (Sarca and Noce basins). On average, less negative values were recorded in the Sarca basin, characterized by a higher contribution of precipitation of Mediterranean origin. In general, isotopic results of the entire water population appeared to be strongly influenced by the regional climatic anomaly of 2018, which was anomalously warm. Therefore, the study will provide additional information for the climate change debate, proposing water isotopes as {ECVs} for assessing change in a warmer future.},

A fully nonlinear, nonhydrostatic, and unstructured three-dimensional (3D) model is used to resolve supertidal dispersion via scalar transport at a well-mixed tidal river junction. Mass transport simulated in the junction is compared against predictions using a simple node-channel model to quantify the effects of small-scale, 3D intrajunction flow features on mixing and dispersion. The effects of three-dimensionality are demonstrated by quantifying the difference between two-dimensional (2D) and 3D model results. An intermediate 3D model that does not resolve the secondary circulation or the recirculating flow at the junction is also compared to the 3D model to quantify the relative sensitivity of mixing on intrajunction flow features. Resolution of complex flow features simulated by the full 3D model is not always necessary because mixing is primarily governed by bulk flow splitting due to the confluence-diffluence cycle. Results in 3D are comparable to the 2D case for many flow pathways simulated, suggesting that 2D modeling may be reasonable for nonstratified and predominantly hydrostatic flows through relatively straight junctions, but not necessarily for the full junction network.},

	abstract = {The import of resources (food, nutrients) sustains biological production and food webs in resource-limited habitats. Resource export from donor habitats subsidizes production in recipient habitats, but the ecosystem-scale consequences of resource translocation are generally unknown. Here, I use a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton model to show how dispersive connectivity between a shallow autotrophic habitat and a deep heterotrophic pelagic habitat can amplify overall system production in metazoan food webs. This result derives from the finite capacity of suspension feeders to capture and assimilate food particles: excess primary production in closed autotrophic habitats cannot be assimilated by consumers; however, if excess phytoplankton production is exported to food-limited heterotrophic habitats, it can be assimilated by zooplankton to support additional secondary production. Transport of regenerated nutrients from heterotrophic to autotrophic habitats sustains higher system primary production. These simulation results imply that the ecosystem-scale efficiency of nutrient transformation into metazoan biomass can be constrained by the rate of resource exchange across habitats and that it is optimized when the transport rate matches the growth rate of primary producers. Slower transport (i.e., reduced connectivity) leads to nutrient limitation of primary production in autotrophic habitats and food limitation of secondary production in heterotrophic habitats. Habitat fragmentation can therefore impose energetic constraints on the carrying capacity of aquatic ecosystems. The outcomes of ecosystem restoration through habitat creation will be determined by both functions provided by newly created aquatic habitats and the rates of hydraulic connectivity between them.},

	abstract = {The possible responses of ecosystem processes to rising atmospheric {CO}2 concentration and climate change are illustrated using six dynamic global vegetation models that explicitly represent the interactions of ecosystem carbon and water exchanges with vegetation dynamics. The models are driven by the {IPCC} {IS}92a scenario of rising {CO}2 (Wigley et al. 1991), and by climate changes resulting from effective {CO}2 concentrations corresponding to {IS}92a, simulated by the coupled ocean atmosphere model {HadCM}2-{SUL}. Simulations with changing {CO}2 alone show a widely distributed terrestrial carbon sink of 1.4-3.8 Pg Cy-1 during the 1990s, rising to 3.7-8.6 Pg Cy-1 a century later. Simulations including climate change show a reduced sink both today (0.6-3.0PgCy-1) and a century later (0.3-6.6PgCy-1) as a result of the impacts of climate change on {NEP} of tropical and southern hemisphere ecosystems. In all models, the rate of increase of {NEP} begins to level off around 2030 as a consequence of the 'diminishing return' of physiological {CO}2 effects at high {CO}2 concentrations. Four out of the six models show a further, climate-induced decline in {NEP} resulting from increased heterotrophic respiration and declining tropical {NPP} after 2050. Changes in vegetation structure influence the magnitude and spatial pattern of the carbon sink and, in combination with changing climate, also freshwater availability (runoff). It is shown that these changes, once set in motion, would continue to evolve for at least a century even if atmospheric {CO}2 concentration and climate could be instantaneously stabilized. The results should be considered illustrative in the sense that the choice of {CO}2 concentration scenario was arbitrary and only one climate model scenario was used. However, the results serve to indicate a range of possible biospheric responses to {CO}2 and climate change. They reveal major uncertainties about the response of {NEP} to climate change resulting, primarily, from differences in the way that modelled global {NPP} responds to a changing climate. The simulations illustrate, however, that the magnitude of possible biospheric influences on the carbon balance requires that this factor is taken into account for future scenarios of atmospheric {CO}2 and climate change.},

	abstract = {Highly resolved general circulation models ({GCMs}) now generate realistic flow fields, and have revealed how sensitive larval drift routes are to vertical positioning in the water column. Sensible representation of behavioural processes then becomes essential to generate reliable patterns of environmental exposure (growth and survival), larval drift trajectories and dispersal. Existing individual-based models involving larval fish allow individuals to vary only in their attributes such as spatial coordinates, and not in their inherited behavioural strategies or phenotypes. We illustrate the interaction between short-term behaviour and longer-term dispersal consequences applying a model of larval cod Gadus morhua drifting in a {GCM}, and show how variations in swimming behaviour influence growth and dispersal. We recommend a deep integration of oceanography and behavioural ecology. First, we need to understand the causes and survival value of behaviours of larval fish, framed in terms of behavioural ecology. Second, we need practices to address how drift and dispersal of offspring are generating spawning strategies (timing and location) of adults, using life history theory. Third, the relative importance of local growth and mortality versus the need to drift to particular areas depend strongly on the mobility of organisms at the time of settling, or the spatial fitness-landscape.

The physical part included a primitive-equation turbulent closure model, and the biological part was a simple phytoplankton (P), Zooplankton (Z), and nutrient (N) model. The model was forced by freshwater discharge from the river and ran prognostically under initial conditions of springtime water stratification and a steady-state solution of the P-Z-N model with no horizontal dependence. A nutrient source was included at the mouth of the river. The model predicted a well-defined density frontal zone on the inner shelf. The biological field showed a region of high phytoplankton biomass in the whole water column near the coast and a moderately high biomass patch in the upper 10 m at the outer edge of the frontal zone. A high concentration dome of nutrients was found near the bottom within the frontal zone. New production of nutrients was high throughout the whole water column near the coast and in the upper 10 m at the outer edge of the density front, but lower in the frontal zone. The model results were in reasonable agreement with observational data taken from a May 1993 interdisciplinary survey on the {LATEX} shelf. Cross-shelf distribution of biological production varied significantly with direction of wind stress but not with the diurnal tide. The model results suggested that the bottom-rich nutrient distribution within the frontal zone was caused by the interaction of physical and biological processes. Physical processes caused the formation of an area of high nutrient concentration in the weak current region within the frontal zone. Subsequent biological processes limited the increase of nutrients in the upper euphotic zone and hence led to the bottom-rich nutrient pattern.},

	abstract = {We investigated the importance of wind-assisted flight for northward (spring) migration by Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) along the Pacific Coast of North America. Using current models of energy costs of flight and recent data on the phenology of migration, we estimated the energy (fat) requirements for migration in calm winds and with wind-assisted flight for different rates of fat deposition: (1) a variable rate, assuming that birds deposit the minimum amount of fat required to reach the next stopover site; (2) a constant maximum rate of 1.0 g/day; and (3) a lower constant rate of 0.4 g/day. We tested these models by comparing conservative estimates of predicted body mass along the migration route with empirical data on body mass of Western Sandpipers at different stopover sites and upon arrival at the breeding grounds. In calm conditions, birds would have to deposit unrealistically high amounts of fat (up to 330\% of observed values) to maintain body mass above absolute lean mass values. Fat-deposition rates of 1.0 g/day and 0.4 g/day, in calm conditions, resulted in a steady decline in body mass along the migration route, with predicted body masses on arrival in Alaska of only 60\% (13.6 g) and 26\% (5.9 g) of average lean mass (22.7 g). Conversely, birds migrating with wind assistance would be able to complete migration with fat-deposition rates as low as 0.4 g/day, similar to values reported for this size bird from field studies. Our results extend the conclusion of the importance of winds for large, long-distance migrants to a small, short-distance migrant. We suggest that the migratory decisions of birds are more strongly influenced by the frequency and duration of winds aloft, i.e. by events during the flight phase, than by events during the stopover phase of migration, such as fat-deposition rate, that have been the focus of much recent migration theory.},

We test these empirical data against the predictions of an optimal migration model assuming that robins minimize time spent on migration, and that fuel deposition rate varies stochastically. The latter assumption sets this model apart from the alternative ones and makes it more realistic. In particular, it is applicable in frequently observed situations when fuel deposition rate is negative. Our model assumes stochastic variation of the fuel deposition rate at sites along the migratory rout and thus is applicable when negative values of fuel deposition rate are recorded. The model predicts the relationship between fuel deposition rate and departure fuel load rather well. The agreement between the observed and the predicted values of optimal stopover duration is much poorer. Predictions of optimal migration theory are known to be dependent on the form of flight equation chosen. Our model fits the data best when the costs of transport are low. This supports the idea that transport costs of fuel stores may be low, especially when fuel stores are modest.},

	abstract = {Migration is a task that implies a route, a goal and a period of time. To achieve this task, it requires orientation abilities to find the goal and energy to cover the distance. Completing such a journey by flying through a moving airspace makes this relatively simple task rather complex. On the one hand birds have to avoid wind drift or have to compensate for displacements to reach the expected goal. On the other hand flight costs make up a large proportion of energy expenditure during migration and, consequently, have a decisive impact on the refuelling requirements and the time needed for migration. As wind speeds are of the same order of magnitude as birds' air speeds, flight costs can easily be doubled or, conversely, halved by wind effects. Many studies have investigated how birds should or actually do react to winds aloft, how they avoid additional costs or how they profit from the winds for their journeys. This review brings together numerous theoretical and empirical studies investigating the flight behaviour of migratory birds in relation to the wind. The results of these studies corroborate that birds select for favourable wind conditions both at departure and aloft to save energy and that for some long-distance migrants a tail-wind is an indispensable support to cover large barriers. Compensation of lateral wind drift seems to vary between age classes, depending on their orientation capacities, and probably between species or populations, due to the variety of winds they face en route. In addition, it is discussed how birds might measure winds aloft, and how flight behaviour with respect to wind shall be tested with field data. © Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V. 2006.},

We describe models and results from experimental flow releases associated with an environmental flow program on the Bill Williams River ({BWR}), Arizona, in arid to semiarid western U.S.A. Two general approaches for improving knowledge and predictions of ecological responses to environmental flows are: (1) coupling physical system models to ecological responses and (2) clarifying empirical relationships between flow and ecological responses through implementation and monitoring of experimental flow releases. We modelled the {BWR} physical system using: (1) a reservoir operations model to simulate reservoir releases and reservoir water levels and estimate flow through the river system under a range of scenarios, (2) one- and two-dimensional river hydraulics models to estimate stage-discharge relationships at the whole-river and local scales, respectively, and (3) a groundwater model to estimate surface- and groundwater interactions in a large, alluvial valley on the {BWR} where surface flow is frequently absent. An example of a coupled, hydrology-ecology model is the Ecosystems Function Model, which we used to link a one-dimensional hydraulic model with riparian tree seedling establishment requirements to produce spatially explicit predictions of seedling recruitment locations in a Geographic Information System. We also quantified the effects of small experimental floods on the differential mortality of native and exotic riparian trees, on beaver dam integrity and distribution, and on the dynamics of differentially flow-adapted benthic macroinvertebrate groups. Results of model applications and experimental flow releases are contributing to adaptive flow management on the {BWR} and to the development of regional environmental flow standards. General themes that emerged from our work include the importance of response thresholds, which are commonly driven by geomorphic thresholds or mediated by geomorphic processes, and the importance of spatial and temporal variation in the effects of flows on ecosystems, which can result from factors such as longitudinal complexity and ecohydrological feedbacks. © Published 2009.},

	abstract = {High resolution numerical atmospheric modeling around a mountain ridge in Northeastern British Columbia ({BC}), Canada was performed in order to examine the influence of meteorology and topography on Golden Eagle migration pathways at the meso-scale (tens of km). During three eagle fall migration periods (2007-2009), local meteorological conditions on the day of peak bird counts were modeled using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System ({RAMS}) mesoscale model. Hourly local surface wind speed, wind direction, temperature, pressure and relative humidity were also monitored during these migration periods. Eagle migration flight paths were observed from the ground and converted to three-dimensional tracks using {ArcGIS}. The observed eagle migration flight paths were compared with the modeled vertical velocity wind fields. Flight tracks across the study area were also simulated using the modeled vertical velocity field in a migration model based on a fluid-flow analogy. It was found that both the large-scale weather conditions and the horizontal wind fields across the study area were broadly similar on each of the modeled migration days. Nonetheless, the location and density of flight tracks across the domain varied between days, with the 2007 event producing more tracks to the southwest of the observation location than the other 2 days. The modeled wind fields suggest that it is not possible for the eagles to traverse the study area without leaving updraft regions, but birds do converge on the locations of updrafts as they move through the area. Statistical associations between observed eagles positions and the vertical velocity field suggest that to the northwest (and to a lesser extent the southwest) of the main study ridge (Johnson col), eagles can always find updrafts but that they must pass through downdraft regions in the {NE} and {SE} as they make their way across the study area. Finally, the simulated flight tracks based on the fluid-flow model and the vertical velocity fields are in general agreement with the observed flight track patterns. Our results suggest that use of high resolution meteorological fields to locate the occurrence of updrafts in proposed ridge-line wind installations could aid in predicting, and mitigating for, convergence points in raptor migrations. © 2013 {ISB}.},

	doi = {10.1007/BF03161678},
	abstract = {This paper describes the 'recruitment box,' an integrative model that defines the stream stage patterns that enable successful establishment of riparian cottonwood seedlings. In western North America, cottonwood seed dispersal generally occurs after annual peak river flows. The receding stream exposes moist sites upon which seeds land after transport by wind and water. Germination is rapid, and initial seedling establishment is often prolific. However, the vast majority of seedlings die, primarily due to drought stress, as root growth is insufficient to maintain contact with the receding zone of moisture. Cottonwood roots grow about 0.5 to 1 cm per day or 60 to 100 cm in the first year. Along the 'losing' streams in semi-arid regions, the riparian water table is an almost horizontal extension from the stream stage. A capillary fringe exists above the water table and is often 30 to 40 cm in elevation, but can range from about 5 to 130 cm depending on substrate texture. The combination of root growth and capillary fringe define the successful recruitment band, which is usually from about 0.6 to 2 m in elevation above the late summer stream stage. Within this range, higher elevation establishment occurs (i) for the Aigeiros cottonwoods, Populus deltoides, and P. fremontii, which grow more rapidly than Tacamahaca species and occur in warmer areas with longer growing seasons; (ii) along larger rivers that are characterized by more gradual stage fluctuations; and (iii) along streams with finer substrate. The rate of stream stage decline is also critical for seedling survival and should not exceed 2.5 cm per day. The recruitment box model is consistent with dendrochronological interpretations that moderate flood events are naturally required for cottonwood recruitment. Flood events with recurrences of about 1 in 5 to 1 in 10 years often satisfy the model and provide stream stage patterns with a gradual decline through the recruitment box. The model will facilitate analyses of the reproductive ecology of riparian cottonwoods and also permit the prescription of stream stage patterns for cottonwood seedling recruitment along dammed rivers.},

These theories are applied to obtain mixed-layer normalized thermal updraft intensity over both flat and complex terrain from the climb rates of soaring American white pelicans and from diagnostic boundary-layer model-produced estimates of the boundary-layer depth zi and the convective velocity scale w*. Comparison of the flatland data with the profiles of normalized updraft velocity obtained from previous studies reveals that the pelican-derived measurements of thermal updraft intensity are in close agreement with those obtained using traditional research aircraft and large eddy simulation ({LES}) in the height range of 0.2 to 0.8 zi. Given the success of this method, the profiles of thermal vertical velocity over the flatland and the nearby mountains are compared. This comparison shows that these profiles are statistically indistinguishable over this height range, indicating that the profile for thermal updraft intensity varies little over this sample of complex terrain. These observations support the findings of a recent {LES} study that explored the turbulent structure of the boundary layer using a range of terrain specifications. For terrain similar in scale to that encountered in this study, results of the {LES} suggest that the terrain caused less than an 11\% variation in the standard deviation of vertical velocity.},

	title = {Considerations in estimating larval dispersal distances from oceanographic data},
	abstract = {Determination of larval dispersal distances and larval origins is a central challenge in contemporary marine ecology. In this work, the larval dispersal problem is discussed from the perspective of oceanography. Following formulation of the advection-diffusion model, the importance of scale is argued. When considering dispersion parameters at the appropriate population scales, advection is usually weaker than initially anticipated (and often used), and diffusion is stronger than typically used in model studies. Focusing attention on coastal populations, the importance of retention zones is described, and the more general existence of a coastal boundary layer is discussed. The coupling of cross-shore and alongshore dispersion results in a nonlinear relation between alongshore dispersal distance and larval planktonic period for dispersion in a sheared flow. Thus, small changes in cross-shore dispersal, whether due to environmental differences or larval behavior result in significant differences in alongshore dispersal. Finally, the interplay between advection and diffusion is explored, showing the importance of adequately representing the diffusive effects that mitigate alongshore advection. In most cases, diffusion acts to prevent ''wash-out'' of a population and allows for more flexibility in the size and spacing of effective marine reserves. Future challenges must bring oceanographers and ecologists together around specific dispersal problems if there is to be a significant improvement in the notable absence of hard data in this field of enquiry.},

	abstract = {San Pablo Bay is a tidal sub-embayment of the San Francisco Estuary which is dominated by broad shallow shoals bisected by a deep channel. Under the conceptual model of sediment transport in San Pablo Bay proposed by Krone (1979), sediment typically enters San Pablo Bay during large winter and spring flows and is redistributed during summer conditions through wind wave resuspension and transport by tidal currents. Numerical simulations of sediment resuspension due to wind waves and the subsequent transport of this sediment by tidal currents show that sediment concentrations and fluxes throughout the channel-shoal system result from a complex temporal and spatial interaction of the waves and tides. The three-dimensional {UnTRIM} San Francisco Bay-Delta Model was coupled with the Simulating {WAves} Nearshore ({SWAN}) wave model and the {SediMorph} morphological model, to develop a three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic, wind wave, and sediment transport model of San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The coupled model was validated using water level, velocity, wind waves and suspended sediment data collected in San Pablo Bay, and then used to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of sediment fluxes on the extensive shoals in San Pablo Bay under a range of tidal and wind conditions. The model validation shows this modeling system can accurately predict hydrodynamics, waves, and suspended sediment concentration in San Pablo Bay. The predicted bottom orbital velocities are elevated across the shoals during large wave events regardless of tidal stage, but near low tide orbital velocities are increased even under low to moderate waves. Sediment fluxes between the shoals and the deeper channel are highest during spring tides, and are elevated for up to a week following wave events, even though the greatest influence of the wave event occurs abruptly. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Floodplains in California and elsewhere are productive natural habitats with high levels of biodiversity, yet today they are often permanently disconnected from rivers by urban or agricultural development and flood management structures. This disconnection poses a threat to many native fish, bird and other species that evolved to take advantage of seasonal floodplain inundation. The traditional restoration approach to this problem is to recreate historical floodplain by restoring natural hydrologic and successional processes. However levees, dams, and development have made this largely impossible in much of the developed world. Reconciliation ecology recognizes this limitation, and encourages instead the re-engineering of human dominated landscapes to allow for coexistence of native species and human uses. Flood control bypasses are particularly promising places to reconcile historical fish and bird uses of floodplain habitats with human uses. However, the reconciliation approach requires nuanced management of a complex system. Using the Yolo Basin flood bypass in California's Central Valley as an example, this study develops formal multi-objective optimization to help planners identify management options that best improve habitat quality for fish and birds with minimal costs to farmers or wetland managers. Models like the one developed here can integrate large amounts of data and knowledge, and offer an explicit accounting of relationships and trade-offs between different objectives. This is especially useful in reconciliation planning, where many uses and variables interact on a landscape, and deliberate re-engineering requires consideration of many decisions simultaneously. Initial results suggest that modest land-use changes and inundation management strategies can significantly improve seasonal bird and fish habitat quality at little cost to farmers or other human land uses. The model applications demonstrate the usefulness of multi-objective optimization in reconciling managed floodplains, and provide a framework for integrating new knowledge and testing varying assumptions to improve management over time.},

Floodplains are formed by a complex interaction of fluvial processes but their character and evolution is essentially the product of stream power and sediment character. The relation between a stream's ability to entrain and transport sediment and the erosional resistance of floodplain alluvium that forms the channel boundary provides the basis for a genetic classification of floodplains. Three classes are recognised: (l) high-energy non-cohesive; (2) medium-energy non-cohesive; and (3) low-energy cohesive floodplains. Thirteen derivative orders and suborders, ranging from confined, coarse-grained, non-cohesive floodplains in high-energy environments to unconfined fine-grained cohesive floodplains in low-energy environments , are defined on the basis of nine factors (mostly floodplain forming processes). These factors result in distinctive geomorphological features (such as scroll bars or extensive backswamps) that distinguish each floodplain type in terms of genesis and resulting morphology. Finally, it is proposed that, because floodplains are derivatives of the parent stream system, substantial environmental change will result in the predictable transformation of one floodplain type to another over time.},

	abstract = {Nutrient loads in fresh and coastal waters continue to lead to harmful algal blooms across the globe. Historically, floodplains—low-lying areas adjacent to streams and rivers that become inundated during high-flow events—would have been nutrient deposition and/or removal sites within riparian corridors, but many floodplains have been developed and/or disconnected. This review synthesizes literature and data available from field studies quantifying nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removal within floodplains across North America and Europe to determine how effective floodplain restoration is at removing nutrients. The mean removal of nitrate-N ({NO}3−-N), the primary form of N in floodplain studies, was 200 ({SD} = 198) kg-N ha−1 yr−1, and of total or particulate P was 21.0 ({SD} = 31.4) kg-P ha−1 yr−1. Based on the literature, more effective designs of restored floodplains should include optimal hydraulic load, permanent wetlands, geomorphic diversity, and dense vegetation. Floodplain restorations along waterways with higher nutrient concentrations could lead to a more effective investment for nutrient removal. Overall, restoring and reconnecting floodplains throughout watersheds is a viable and effective means of removing nutrients while also restoring the many other benefits that floodplains provide.},

Heterotrophic flagellates totally dominate as bacterivores. In the oxycline a quite different group of clliates occur; it 1s dominated by bacterivorous scuticociliates. Beneath the oxycline, in strictly anoxic and sulphide containing water, an assemblage of specialised anaerobic ciliates occurs. The high bacterial productivity in the oxycline is reflected by a biomass maximum of ciliates and to a lesser degree of heterotrophic flagellates. In anoxic microbial communities the biomass ratio between phagotrophs and their prey is much lower than in aerobic communities due to the low net growth efficiency of anaerobic eukaryotes The potential significance of methane production by methanogenic symbionts of anaerobic protozoa is discussed.},

In this study, we found evidence of deterministic community assembly mechanisms in zooplankton communities in floodplain and seasonally inundated off-channel habitats in California’s Central Valley. Additionally, we found that all sampled off-channel floodplain habitat types had similar zooplankton communities and that assembly in floodplain habitats was governed by variables associated with increased water residence time.

The lake is north±south oriented, with a maximum extension of 2.2 km and is situated in a dead ice hole with steep slopes on the east and west coasts. A part of the coastal area is covered with forest, creating a strong shelter from prevailing south-westerly winds. The system of shallow water equations is discretized with the modi®ed Utnes (1990) scheme which is characterized by a semi-decoupling algorithm. The continuity equation is rearranged to Helmholtz equation form. The upwinding Tabata (1977) method is used to approximate convective terms. Extensive wind (more than 60 observations) and current measurements (5 points) conducted all over the lake enabled us to verify the simulation results with observations. Under spatially homogeneous wind conditions the model predicts a two cell circulation system, that covers most part of the lake. Taking the spatial variation of wind speed due to shelter into account, the ¯ow ®eld changes drastically. The two cell system is replaced by one large cell, with a strong reverse jet along the western shore. The sheltering eect of the surrounding hills and vegetation have a pronounced eect on the circulation pattern.

We report landscape-scale and seasonal variation in abundance, size, hatchery production (based on adipose fin clips), and genetic stock of origin of juvenile Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. From fish implanted with coded wire tags ({CWTs}), we also determined the sites of release and inferred migration patterns. Chinook salmon were found in diverse life history stages and forms, including fry migrants, fingerlings, and (fewer) yearlings. Abundance increased in February and decreased in August, but salmon were present in all months each year. Spatial gradients in abundance and size were strong, with fewer but larger fish in brackish than in tidal freshwater zones. Overall, 30\% of the Chinook salmon measured were fry (≤60 mm) that were likely naturally produced fish. These occurred at higher mean monthly proportions in tidal freshwater than in estuarine zones. In contrast, most larger fish were probably raised in hatcheries. Genetic stock assessment revealed that the majority of the Chinook salmon analyzed were from fall-run stock groups originating in the lower Columbia River, with 15\% originating from other stock groups. Of these minority contributors, about 6\% were identified as upper Columbia River summer–fall-run Chinook salmon while seven other stock groups accounted for the remainder, including 3\% from transplants originating in southern Oregon's Rogue River. Recaptures of tagged fish revealed maximum migration times of 143 d for subyearlings and 52 d for yearlings, and both {CWT} and genetic data indicated that fall Chinook salmon from coastal rivers occasionally entered the estuary. These data demonstrated a widespread temporal and spatial distribution of subyearling Chinook salmon in shallow-water habitats of the lower Columbia River and estuary.},

	abstract = {The sustained swimming speeds of juvenile coho and chinook salmon tested in a tubular cham-ber at temperatures ranging from 10 to 20 ø C. usually were dependent on the dissolved oxygen concentration at any tried concentration below the air-saturation level. Some underyearling chinook salmon tested at 19.5 ø C. were notably exceptional; their performance at high oxygen concentrations was not markedly better than that observed at lower concentrations between 5 and 7 rag/1. These fish may have been anemic. Reduction of oxygen concentration from air-saturation levels to 7, 6, 5, 4, and 3 rag/1 usually resulted in reduction of the maximum sustained swimming speed of coho salmon by about 5, 8, 13, 20, and 30 percent, respectively. These per-centages are based on the observed performance of the first-failing and second-failing individuals of a group of five fish used in a performance test. The corresponding estimated percent re-ductions of the swimming speed of first-failing fish in most of the early exploratory experiments with chinook salmon were somewhat greater, averaging approximately 10, 14, 20, 27, and 38 percent, respectively. Within the ranges of tested concentrations above the saturation levels, variations of oxygen concentration had little or no effect on the performance of wild under-yearling and hatchery-reared yearling coho salmon. The performance of the wild underyearlings at tested oxygen concentrations improved progressively with increase of temperature from 10 to 15 and to 20 ø C.},

	abstract = {Building on previous environmental flow discussions and a growing recognition that hydrogeomorphic processes are inherent in the ecological functionality and biodiversity of riverscapes, we propose a functional-flows approach to managing heavily modified rivers. The approach focuses on retaining specific process-based components of the hydrograph, or functional flows, rather than attempting to mimic the full natural flow regime. Key functional components include wet-season initiation flows, peak magnitude flows, recession flows, dry-season low flows, and interannual variability. We illustrate the importance of each key functional flow using examples from western {US} rivers with seasonably predictable flow regimes. To maximize the functionality of these flows, connectivity to morphologically diverse overbank areas must be enhanced in both space and time, and consideration must be given to the sediment-transport regime. Finally, we provide guiding principles for developing functional flows or incorporating functional flows into existing environmental flow frameworks.},

	abstract = {© 2017. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. This article has been contributed to by {US} Government employees and their work is in the public domain in the {USA}. Water temperature is an important factor determining estuarine species habitat conditions. Water temperature is mainly governed by advection (e.g., from rivers) and atmospheric exchange processes varying strongly over time (day-night, seasonally) and the spatial domain. On a long time scale, climate change will impact water temperature in estuarine systems due to changes in river flow regimes, air temperature, and sea level rise. To determine which factors govern estuarine water temperature and its sensitivity to changes in its forcing, we developed a process-based numerical model (Delft3D Flexible Mesh) and applied it to a well-monitored estuarine system (the San Francisco Estuary) for validation. The process-based approach allows for detailed process description and a physics-based analysis of governing processes. The model was calibrated for water year 2011 and incorporated 3-D hydrodynamics, salinity intrusion, water temperature dynamics, and atmospheric coupling. Results show significant skill in reproducing temperature observations on daily, seasonal, and yearly time scales. In North San Francisco Bay, thermal stratification is present, enhanced by salinity stratification. The temperature of the upstream, fresh water Delta area is captured well in 2-D mode, although locally—on a small scale—vertical processes (e.g., stratification) may be important. The impact of upstream river temperature and discharge and atmospheric forcing on water temperatures differs throughout the Delta, possibly depending on dispersion and residence times. Our modeling effort provides a sound basis for future modeling studies including climate change impact on water temperature and associated ecological modeling, e.g., clam and fish habitat and phytoplankton dynamics.},

The fluid mechanics formulation and its suitability and accuracy for rotating turbulent flows; 3. The coupling of air flow and a rotating rigid body. In Part 2, we focus on the structural discretization for wind turbine blades and the details of the fluid–structure interaction computational procedures. The methods developed are applied to the simulation of the {NREL} 5MW offshore baseline wind turbine rotor. The simulations are performed at realistic wind velocity and rotor speed conditions and at full spatial scale. Validation against published data is presented and possibilities of the newly developed computational framework are illustrated on several examples.},

	abstract = {Hydro-(major and trace elements: Cd, F and Sr), isotope (18O, 2H, 3H and 13C) geochemistry and radiogenic carbon (14C) of dissolved inorganic carbon ({DIC}) were used to investigate the sources of groundwater contamination and the hydrodynamic functioning of the multilayer aquifer system in the mining Gafsa basin (Southwestern Tunisia). The groundwater of the study area is subject to intense exploitation to accommodate all the water demands of this arid area. The Gafsa basin contains a multi-layered aquifer with four principal levels: Upper Zebbag (Cenomanian-Turonian), Abiod (Campanien-Maastrichian), Beglia (Miocene) and Segui (Plio-Quaternary) Formations. The hydrogeology of this system is largely affected by tectonics (Gafsa-Tebessa, Sehib, Negrine-Tozeur, Tabeddit and Metlaoui faults...). The groundwater of these aquifers undergoes a significant decline in water level (≈0.5my-1), increasing salinity ({TDS} increase from 400 to 800-6000mgl-1: generally, {TDS} increases from the mountainous regions towards the discharge area) due to a long time of aridity, irregular rainfall and overexploitation (irrigation and industrial activities). Groundwater pumped from the semi-confined Complex Terminal (C.T) aquifers (Cretaceous and Mio-Plio-Quaternary: {MPQ}) and from the confined Continental Intercalaire (C.I) aquifers is an important production factor in irrigated oases agriculture and phosphate washing in Southwestern Tunisia. A rise in the groundwater salinity has been observed as a consequence of increasing abstraction from the aquifer during the last few decades. The salinization phenomena in the region are complex. Several possible causes for salinization exist: (1) the upwelling of saline and "fossil" water from the underlying, confined "C.I" aquifer; (2) as well as the backflow of agricultural drainage water; (3) phosphate and domestic wastewater; (4) brine intrusion from the salt lake (Sebkha/Garaat); (5) evaporate meteoric water dams (El Khangua and El Oudeï); (6) reduced rainfall and (7) land and air alterations. The istopic study of waters establishes that the deep groundwater is "fossil" water (6000-37,000years) recharged probably during the late Pleistocene and the early Holocene periods. The relatively recent water in the {MPQ} aquifer is composed of mixed waters resulting presumably from upward leakage from the deeper groundwater. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Stable isotope measurements and isotope mass balance ({IMB}) calculations are presented in support of an unprecedented 20-year water balance assessment for a tailings pond and a chain of downstream lakes at the Salmita-Tundra mine site, situated near Courageous Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada (65°03'N; 111°11'W). The method is shown to provide a comprehensive annual and interannual perspective of water balance fluxes along a chain of lakes during the period 1991-2010, without the need for continuous streamflow gauging, and reveals important lake-order-dependent patterns of land-surface runoff, discharge accumulation, and several key diagnostic ratios, i.e., evaporation/inflow, evaporation/evapotranspiration, land-surface-runoff/precipitation and discharge/ precipitation. Lake evaporation is found to be a significant component of the water balance, accounting for between 26\% and 32\% of inflow to natural lakes and between 72\% and 100\% of inflow to mine-tailings ponds. Evaporation/evapotranspiration averages between 7\% and 22\% and is found to be higher in low-precipitation years, and in watersheds with a higher proportion of lakes. Runoff ratios for land-surface drainages and runoff ratios for watersheds (including lakes) ranged between 14-47\% and 20-47\%, respectively, and were higher in low precipitation years, in watersheds with a higher proportion of lakes, and in watersheds less affected by mining development. We propose that in general these two runoff ratios will likely converge as lake order increases and as land cover conditions become regionally representative. Notably, the study demonstrates application of {IMB}, validated with streamflow measurements, to constrain local water balance in a remote low-arctic region. For {IMB} chain-of-lakes applications, it underlines the importance of accounting for evaporatively-enriched upstream sources to avoid overestimation of evaporation losses.},

	abstract = {This study addresses the influence of landslide dams on surface water drainage and groundwater flow. In the study area of Scanno Lake and Sagittario River (Central Italy), a limestone rockslide-avalanche formed a lake, which has an outlet that is occasionally active, showing infiltration into the rockslide dam. Several springs are present at the lake's base and are partly fed by seepage through the rockslide debris. Piezometric surveys, discharge measurements, pumping tests and chemical analyses are tools used to build a conceptual model of the groundwater flow and to evaluate the flow through the rockslide debris. Seasonal water isotopic signatures validate the assumed model, showing a mixing of infiltration recharge and groundwater seepage throughout the rockslide debris. Various recharge areas have been found for springs, pointing out those directly fed by the rockslide debris aquifer. Hypotheses about seasonal groundwater mixing between the regional carbonate aquifer and the rockslide debris aquifer are supported by isotope results. Seasonal changes in groundwater table level due to recharge and surface losses from seasonal outlet have been correlated with isotopic groundwater composition from the rockslide debris aquifer and the downstream springs; this relationship highlights the role of the rockslide dam body on the hydrodynamics of the studied area. Relationships between surface waters and groundwater in the area have been completely understood on the basis of water isotopic fingerprinting, finally obtaining a complete evaluation of groundwater renewable resources and its regimen. © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this context, minimum flow regulations are applied to mitigate adverse impacts and to protect affected river reaches from environmental deterioration. Mostly, however, only selected instream criteria are considered, neglecting the floodplain as an indispensable part of the fluvial ecosystem. Based on essential functions and processes of unimpaired temperate floodplain rivers, we identify fundamental principles to which we must adhere to determine truly ecologically-relevant environmental flows. Literature reveals that the natural flow regime and its seasonal components are primary drivers for functions and processes of abiotic and biotic elements such as morphology, water quality, floodplain, groundwater, riparian vegetation, fish, macroinvertebrates, and amphibians, thus preserving the integrity of floodplain river ecosystems. Based on the relationship between key flow regime elements and associated environmental components within as well as adjacent to the river, we formulate a process-oriented functional floodplain flow (ff-flow) approach which offers a holistic conceptual framework for environmental flow assessment in temperate floodplain river systems. The ff-flow approach underlines the importance of emulating the natural flow regime with its seasonal variability, flow magnitude, frequency, event duration, and rise and fall of the hydrograph. We conclude that the ecological principles presented in the ff-flow approach ensure the protection of floodplain rivers impacted by flow regulation by establishing ecologically relevant environmental flows and guiding flow restoration measures.},

	abstract = {Natural physical conditions and the politics of flood management provide the historical context for structural flood control that underlies modern flood hazards in the Sacramento Valley. The valley is a broad, low plain with backswamp basins that were frequently inundated prior to Anglo-American settlement, continuing until the modern flood-control system was established. Early attempts to emulate the Mississippi River single-channel levee strategy failed repeatedly in the Sacramento Valley due to high flow variability, mining sedimentation, lack of a coordinated levee system, and the inability of the main channels to carry most of the flood flows. Hydraulic mining caused massive sedimentation in major east-side tributaries, such as the Feather, Yuba, Bear, and American Rivers, and in the Sacramento River below the Feather River confluence. This sedimentation led to a flood-control design that relied on levees with narrow cross-channel spacings to promote channel scour and facilitate navigation. Even without sedimentation, floods were not contained within channels, but were largely conveyed through a system of low-land basins. In the early twentieth century, an innovative channel bypass system was adopted that emulates the natural system by routing excess flood waters over a series of weirs and through broad, channelized bypasses that cross the basins. This system has been successful in reducing the extent of frequent inundations of broad lowland areas of the valley. It is in need of maintenance and improvement, however, and cannot eliminate the risk of future flooding in low areas behind levees that are being rapidly developed. © 2008 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {We review some of the classic literature on geomorphology and ecology of streams in an effort to examine how theoretical developments in these aquatic sciences have influenced the way fresh flowing waters are classified. Our aim was to provide a historical examination of conceptual developments related to fluvial classification, and to discuss implications for conservation planning and resource management. Periods of conceptual influences can be separated into three overlapping phases each distinguished by theoretical, analytical or technological advances: (i) early Darwinian perspectives; (ii) the quantitative revolution; and, (iii) age of the computer, hierarchy and scale. During the first phase, stream geomorphologists were largely influenced by Darwinian metaphors. The study of stream origin and change through time became more important than the study of stream systems themselves. The idea that streams progress deterministically through successive stages of development seemed to create a veil, most prevalently in North America, that barred analysis of the full scope of variability in these systems for over 50years. The quantitative revolution brought about many new ideas and developments, including the laws of stream numbers. This period focused on predictive and mechanistic explanations of stream processes, setting the stage for physically based stream classifications that assume that streams can be restored by engineering their physical characteristics. In the most recent 'age of the computer', concepts from the fields of geographic information science and landscape ecology have been incorporated into stream ecology and aquatic classification. This has led to investigations in stream and aquatic ecosystems at hierarchical spatial scales and along different dimensions (upstream/downstream, riparian/floodplain, channel/ground water and through time). Yet, in contrast to terrestrial landscapes, flowing waters are not as easily classified into spatially nested hierarchical regions wherein upper levels can be subdivided into smaller and smaller regions at finer spatial scales. Riverscapes are perhaps best described as directionally nested hierarchies: aquatic elements further downstream cannot be rendered equivalently to elements upstream. Moreover, fully integrated aquatic ecosystem classifications that incorporate lake and river networks, wetlands, groundwater reservoirs and upland areas are exceedingly rare. We reason that the way forward for classification of flowing waters is to account for the directionally nested nature of these networks and to encode flexibility into modern digital freshwater inventories and fluvial classification models. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Unregulated tributaries can increase biodiversity in regulated environments by contributing colonists to the main channel and creating transitional habitats at a stream junction. We assessed whether unregulated tributaries influence macroinvertebrate communities in two mainstem rivers during summer low-flows. Three tributary junctions of upland cobble-gravel bed streams were surveyed in an unregulated and a regulated river in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, {USA}. We found distinct physical habitat conditions and increased macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity in unregulated tributaries on the regulated river, but macroinvertebrate diversity did not increase downstream of tributary junctions as predicted. On the unregulated river, macroinvertebrate diversity was similar in upstream, downstream and unregulated tributary sites. Our findings highlight that unregulated tributaries support high macroinverte-brate diversity and heterogeneous communities compared to the mainstem sites in a regulated river, and thus likely support ecological processes, such as spill-over predation, breeding and refugia use for mobile taxa. We suggest unregulated tributaries are an integral component of river networks, serving as valuable links in the landscape for enhancing biodiversity , and should be protected in conservation and management plans.},

	volume = {37},
	abstract = {From headwaters to mouth, the physical variables within a river system present a con-tinuous gradient of physical conditions. This gradient should elicit a series of responses within the constituent populations resulting in a continuum of biotic adjustments and consistent patterns of loading, transport, utilization, and storage of organic matter along the length of a river. Based on the energy equilibrium theory of fluvial geomorphologists, we hypothesize that the structural and functional characteristics of stream conununities are adapted to conform to the most probable position or mean state of the physical system. We reason that producer and consumer communities characteristic of a given river reach become established in harmony with the dynamic physical conditions of the channel. In natural stream systems, biological communities can be characterized as forming a temporal continuum of synchronized species replacements. This continuous replacement functions to distribute the utilization of energy inputs over time. Thus, the biological system moves towards a balance between a tendency for efficient use of energy inputs through resource partitioning (food, substrate, etc.) and an opposing tendency for a uniform rate of energy processing throughout the year. We theorize that biological communities developed in natural streams assume processing strategies involving minimum energy loss. Downstream communities are fashioned to capitalize on upstream processing inefficiencies. Both the upstream inefficiency (leakage) and the downstream adjust-ments seem predictable. We propose that this River Continuum Concept provides a frame-work for integrating predictable and observable biological features of lotic systems.

This enormous loss may reflect numerous anthropogenic influences, such as watershed damming, bay-fill development, aggregate mining, and dredging. The reduction in Bay sediment also appears to be linked to a reduction in sediment supply and recent widespread erosion of adjacent beaches, wetlands, and submarine environments. A unique, multi-faceted provenance study was performed to definitively establish the primary sources, sinks, and transport pathways of beach-sized sand in the region, thereby identifying the activities and processes that directly limit supply to the outer coast. This integrative program is based on comprehensive surficial sediment sampling of the San Francisco Bay Coastal System, including the seabed, Bay floor, area beaches, adjacent rock units, and major drainages.

The above models are coupled with the Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, and the risk probability analysis model for sudden water pollution in the plain river network is established and applied to the Yixing river network. The results show that (a) the risk probability of exceeding ammonia nitrogen standard ({PES} of ammonia nitrogen) is lower in the upper reaches and higher in the middle and lower reaches; (b) dynamic changes in pollutant concentration lead to different changes in the {PES} of ammonia nitrogen in each reach; (c) the differences in the simulated {PES} values between the sudden scheme and the stable scheme ({NPES} of ammonia nitrogen) in the upper and middle reaches show a patchy distribution of high and low values, which are related to the risk source location, the water movement direction and the concentration change in the reach after accepting pollutant loads from the risk sources; (d) the {NPES} of ammonia nitrogen in the lower reaches results from the coupling effect caused by accidental discharges from multiple risk sources; and (e) the different effects of the lower boundary hydrological conditions on the upstream water inflow lead to the different coupling effect on the water quality probability of sections in the downstream area.},

	abstract = {For many floodplain rivers, reinstating wetland connectivity is necessary for ecosystems to recover from decades of regulation. Environmental return flows (the managed delivery of wetland water to an adjacent river) can be used strategically to facilitate natural ecosystem connectivity, enabling the transfer of nutrients, energy, and biota from wetland habitats to the river. Using an informal adaptive management framework, we delivered return flows from a forested wetland complex into a large lowland river in south-eastern Australia. We hypothesized that return flows would (a) increase river nutrient concentrations; (b) reduce wetland nutrient concentrations; (c) increase rates of ecosystem metabolism through the addition of potentially limiting nutrients, causing related increases in the concentration of water column chlorophyll-a; and (d) increase the density and species richness of microinvertebrates in riverine benthic habitats. Our monitoring results demonstrated a small increase in the concentrations of several key nutrients but no evidence for significant ecological responses was found. Although return flows can be delivered from forested floodplain areas without risking hypoxic blackwater events, returning nutrient and carbon-rich water to increase riverine productivity is limited by the achievable scale of return flows. Nevertheless, using return flows to flush carbon from floodplains may be a useful management tool to reduce carbon loads, preparing floodplains for subsequent releases (e.g., mitigating the risk of hypoxic blackwater events). In this example, adaptive management benefited from a semi-formal collaboration between science and management that allowed for prompt decision-making.},

Application of the calibrated model to simulate water-quality responses to a pollution source showed that the contribution of a pollution source to water quality in the lake has strong spatial heterogeneity. The results provide useful information for the optimization of pollution load reduction in Lake Bali and can be used to determine the most effective implementation of its pollution-control plan.

To date, most research efforts have developed tools to expedite labor- A nd time-intensive contaminant identification efforts. However, even without chemical identity, the richness of nontarget {HRMS} data sets represents a significant opportunity to chemically differentiate samples and delineate source contributions. To develop this potential, we evaluated the use of unidentified {HRMS} detections to define sample uniqueness and provide additional statistical resolution for quantitative source apportionment, overcoming a critical limitation of existing approaches based on targeted contaminants. By creating a series of sample mixtures that mimic pollution sources in a representative watershed, we assessed the fidelity of {HRMS} source fingerprints during dilution and mixing. This approach isolated 8-447 nontarget compounds per sample for source apportionment and yielded accurate source concentration estimates (between 0.82 and 1.4-fold of actual values), even in multisource systems with {\textless}1\% source contributions. Furthermore, we mined the nontarget data to identify five source-specific chemical end-members amenable to apportionment. While additional development studies are needed to fully evaluate the myriad factors affecting method accuracy and capabilities, this study provides a conceptual foundation for novel applications of nontarget {HRMS} data to confidently distinguish and quantify source impacts in complex systems.},

However, studies examining runoff generation in tropical catchments with highly permeable soils have received little attention, particularly in tropical dry forests. We present a study focused on identifying the dominant flowpaths, water sources and stream water residence times in a tropical dry forest catchment near the Pacific coast of central Mexico. During the wet season, pre-event water contributions to stormflow ranged from 72\% to 97\%, with the concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium closely coupling the geochemistry of baseflow and groundwater from the narrow riparian/near-stream zone. Baseflow from the intermittent stream showed a strongly damped isotopic signature and a mean baseflow residence time of 52-110. days was estimated. These findings all suggest that instead of the surface and near-surface subsurface lateral pathways observed over many tropical catchments, runoff is generated through vertical flow processes and the displacement and discharge of stored water from the saturated zone. As the wet season progressed, contributions from the saturated zone persisted; however, the stormflow and baseflow geochemistry suggests that the contributing area of the catchment increased. Our results show that during the early part of the wet season, runoff originated primarily from the headwater portion of the catchment. As the wet season progressed and catchment wetness increased, connectivity among sub-basin was improved, resulting in runoff contributions from across the entire catchment.},

To better simulate dispersion caused by bifurcation and merging at junctions, a localized model is proposed in which particles move along potential flow streamlines through junctions. The model is applied to the Sacramento- San Joaquin Delta in the California Central Valley, and the approach reproduces the observed ultimate fate of the endangered native fish Delta smelt more accurately than a model that fully randomizes particle positions at junctions. The new model also reproduces the very large dispersion that has been previously inferred from Delta-wide heat balances; this large dispersion appears to be associated with flow splits at junctions. Overall, the streamline-following model is likely to be more accurate for long-term planning and management simulations of such complex estuaries than more commonly used cross-sectionally averaged Lagrangian transport equation solvers, which randomize concentration distributions of scalars at junctions, and thereby do not reproduce the increased dispersion mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The need of addressing "residual flood risk" associated with structural protection measures, such as levee systems and flood-control reservoirs, has fostered actions aimed at increasing flood risk awareness. Structural measures have lowered risk perception by inducing a false sense of safety. As a result, these structures contribute to an underestimation of the "residual risk". We analyze the effect of different reservoir operations, such as coping with drought versus coping with flood events, on flood inundation patterns. First, a hydrological model simulates different scenarios, which represent the dam regulation strategies. Each regulation strategy is the combination of an opening of the outlet gate and of the initial water level in the reservoir. Second, the corresponding outputs of the dam in terms of maximum discharge values are estimated. Then, in turn, each output of the dam is used as an upstream boundary condition of a hydraulic model used to simulate the flood propagation and the inundation processes in the river reach. The hydraulic model is thus used to determine the effect, in terms of inundated areas, of each dam regulation scenario. Finally, the ensemble of all flood inundation maps is built to define the areas more prone to be flooded. The test site is the Casanuova dam (Umbria, central Italy) which aims at: (i) mitigating floods occurring at the Chiascio River, one of the main tributaries of Tiber River, while (ii) providing water supply for irrigation. Because of these two competitive interests, the understanding of different scenarios generated by the dam operations offers an unique support to flood mitigation strategies. Results can lead to draw interesting remarks for a wide number of case studies.},

The isotope fractionations that accompany the evaporation from the ocean and other surface waters and the reverse process of rain formation account for the most notable changes. As a result, meteoric waters are depleted in the heavy isotopic species of H and O relative to ocean waters, whereas waters in evaporative systems such as lakes, plants, and soilwaters are relatively enriched. During the passage through the aquifers, the isotope composition of water is essentially a conservative property at ambient temperatures, but at elevated temperatures, interaction with the rock matrix may perturb the isotope composition. These changes of the isotope composition in atmospheric waters, surface water, soil, and groundwaters, as well as in the biosphere, are applied in the characterization of hydrological system as well as indicators of paleo-climatological conditions in proxy materials in climatic archives, such as ice, lake sediments, or organic materials.},

Although it is known that local and regional sources of these metals contribute to deposition in the Great Lakes region, it is difficult to trace emissions from point sources to impacted sites. Recent studies suggest that metal isotope ratios may be useful for distinguishing between and tracing source emissions. We measured Pb, strontium (Sr), and Hg isotope ratios in daily precipitation samples that were collected at seven sites across the Great Lakes region between 2003 and 2007. Lead isotope ratios ( 207 Pb/ 206 Pb=0.8062 to 0.8554) suggest that Pb deposition was influenced by coal combustion and processing of Mississippi Valley-Type Pb ore deposits. Regional differences in Sr isotope ratios ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr=0.70859 to 0.71155) are likely related to coal fly ash and soil dust. Mercury isotope ratios (δ 202 Hg=-1.13 to 0.13‰) also varied among the sites, likely due to regional differences in coal isotopic composition, and fractionation occurring within industrial facilities and in the atmosphere. These data represent the first combined characterization of Pb, Sr, and Hg isotope ratios in precipitation collected across the Great Lakes region. We demonstrate the utility of multiple metal isotope ratios in parallel with traditional trace element multivariate statistical modeling to enable more complete pollution source attribution.},

The local meteoric water line is established by using the relationship between the stable isotope of oxygen-18 and deuterium, which is slightly different from the meteoric water line of China. The isotopic temporal variation of precipitation is closely related to exchange effect between raindrops and environmental vapor, evaporation fractionation and rainfall intensity. The isotopic variation of shallow soil water is mainly determined by canopy interception, ground evaporation and the mixing with pre-event water; as for the isotopic variation of deep soil water, it is virtually influenced by pre-event water. The most enriched isotopic composition of streamflow and deuterium excess (d-excess) differences between streamflow and rainfall both indicate that streamflow is recharged not only by event water but also by pre-event water. Hence, a better understanding of precipitation formation and the hydrological response under the plum rainfall system may be instructive for the management of water resources in humid watersheds in southern China.},

	abstract = {Mass-balance models using stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen provide useful estimates of the water balance of lakes, particularly in the absence of instrumental data. However, isotopic mass balances are rarely compared directly to measured water fluxes. Here we compared instrumental and isotope-based determinations of water fluxes in seven connected lakes over 12 years to quantify how agreement between the two approaches is affected by lake type and its position in the landscape. Overall, lake-specific ratios of evaporation to inflow (E/I) from instrumental measurements (median, x̃ = 0.06, median absolute deviation, {MAD} = 0.06) agreed well with isotopic estimates using headwater models (x̃ = 0.14, {MAD} =0.08), with the exception of one lake with limited channelized inflow of surface waters (x̃instrumental = 0.51 vs. x̃headwater = 0.24). Isotope-instrument agreement improved (x̃ = 0.09 vs. x̃ = 0.03) when basin-specific (‘best-fit’) isotope models also considered local connectivity to upstream water bodies. Comparison among years revealed that mean isotopic E/I values were lowest in 2011 (mean, μ = 0.06, standard deviation, σ = 0.09) during a 1-in-140 year spring flood, and highest during a relatively arid year, 2003 (μ = 0.22, σ = 0.19), while interannual variability in E/I generally increased with distance downstream along the mainstem of the watershed. Similar patterns of agreement between methods were recorded for water-residence time. Isotope models also documented the expected low water yield from lake catchments (μ = 36.2 mm yr-1, σ = 62.3) suggesting that isotope models based on late-summer samples integrate annual inputs from various sources that are difficult to measure with conventional methods. Overall, the positive agreement between methods confirms that water isotopes can provide substantial insights into landscape patterns of lake hydrology, even in ungauged systems.},

	abstract = {Depth profiles were sampled at different locations throughout Lake Geneva on a monthly and seasonal basis over the course of 2. years and analysed for their stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions. The isotopic compositions indicate an isotopic stratification in the metalimnion during summer and fall. This is related to mixing of Rhône River water, which in summer is dominated by snow and glacier melt waters, and lake water, with the latter having a homogenous isotopic composition. The observed interflow layer is 7-15. m thick and can be traced by the distinct stable isotope composition of the water for about 55. km throughout the lake as well as into shallow bay regions. Depth of the interflow layer close to the Rhône River mouth is similar to those previously described based on echo-soundings and turbidity profiles of sediment dispersion. In contrast to previous descriptions of the interflow within Lake Geneva, the stable isotope compositions allow for direct, natural tracing of the Rhône River water even in cases where the turbidity and conductivity measurements do not indicate such an interflow. In addition, the method allows for a quantification of the Rhône River and lake water in the interflow with the fraction of Rhône River water within the interflow estimated to be up to 37\% in summer. The isotopic composition further indicates different vertical mixing processes within the two lake basins of Lake Geneva, related to the density gradients and local stability within the water column. The method may be applicable to other lakes in catchments with large differences in the topography as water that originates from high altitudes or glaciers has a distinct oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition compared to other sources of water originating at lower altitudes and/or from direct precipitation over the lake. Stable isotope measurements thus improve the understanding of the circulation of water within the lake, which is fundamental for an evaluation of the water residence times, dissolved pollutant and nutrient transport as well as oxygenation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

In order to direct future research into process-based hydrological connectivity this paper: i) evaluates the extent to which different concepts of hydrological connectivity have emerged from different approaches to measure and predict flow in different environments; ii) discusses the extent to which these different concepts are mutually compatible; and iii) assesses further research to contribute to a unified understanding of hydrological processes. Existing research is categorised into five different approaches to investigating hydrological connectivity: i) evaluating soil-moisture patterns (soil-moisture connectivity); ii) understanding runoff patterns and processes on hillslopes (flow-process connectivity); iii) investigating topographic controls (terrain-connectivity) including the impact of road networks on hydrological connectivity and catchment runoff; iv) developing models to explore and predict hydrological connectivity; and v) developing indices of hydrological connectivity. Analysis of published research suggests a relationship between research group, approach, geographic setting and the interpretation of hydrological connectivity. For further understanding of hydrological connectivity our knowledge needs to be developed using a range of techniques and approaches, there should be common understandings between researchers approaching the concept from different perspectives, and these meanings need to be communicated effectively with those responsible for land management. © 2013.},

We examined a large {DOM} dataset from the National Water Information System of the {US} Geological Survey, which represents approximately 100 000 measurements of {DOC} concentration and {DOM} composition at many sites along rivers across the United States. Application of quantile regression revealed a tendency towards downstream spatial and temporal homogenization of {DOC} concentrations and a shift from dominance of aromatic {DOM} in headwaters to more aliphatic {DOM} downstream. The {DOC} concentration–discharge (C-Q) relationships at each site revealed a downstream tendency towards a slope of zero. We propose that despite complexities in river networks that have driven many revisions to the River Continuum Concept, rivers show a tendency towards chemostasis (C-Q slope of zero) because of a downstream shift from a dominance of hydrologic drivers that connect {terrestrialDOMsources} to streams in the headwaters towards a dominance of instream and near-stream biogeochemical processes that result in preferential losses of aromatic {DOM} and preferential gains of aliphatic {DOM}.},

	abstract = {The challenge on implementation of the {EU} Water Framework Directive ({WFD}) (2000/60/{EC}) fosters the development of new monitoring approaches. The directive promotes the use of modelling techniques to assist all phases of the process, from characterization and establishment of reference conditions to identification of pressures and assessment of impact. This work is based on the above principles. A classical monitoring of the water status of the main transitional water bodies of Algarve (South of Portugal) is combined with advanced in situ water profiling and hydrodynamic, water quality and ecological modelling to build a complete description of the system. The aim is to demonstrate a methodology where traditional monitoring and modelling tools can be joined together to draw a holistic picture. The results show that globally the water bodies present a good trophic status. Eutrophication symptoms are not generalized. Due to physical transport and dispersion, nutrient enrichment is not the only factor limiting growth; residence time is also an important factor. Some confined regions with high residence times are at present endangered by point and diffuse sources of pollution. The microbiologic impact of waste water treatment plants ({WWTP}) is confined to regions between 500m and 1 km from the discharges. © {IWA} Publishing 2009.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel methodology for time reversal in advective-diffusive pollutant transport in groundwater systems and other environmental flow systems (specifically: time reversal of diffusive terms). The method developed in this paper extends previous particle-based approaches like the Reversed Time Particle Tracking Method of Bagtzoglou [6]. The reversal of the 'diffusive' and/or 'macrodispersive' component of pollutant migration is especially under focus here. The basis of the proposed scheme for anti-diffusion is a continuous time, censored, non-local random walk capable of tracking groundwater solute concentration profiles over time while conserving the (reverse) Fickian properties of the anti-diffusing particle cloud in terms of moments. This scheme is an alternative to the direct solution of the eulerian concentration-based diffusion {PDE}, which is notoriously unstable in reverse time. Our analysis leads to the conclusion that an adaptive time stepping scheme-with decreasing time step-is necessary in order to maintain a constant amount of anti-diffusion (the reverse form of Fick's law). Specifically, we study the relations between the following parameters: time step evolution vs. time (or vs. number of steps); variance evolution (decrease rate); total time (or number of steps) required to reach a fully anti-diffused solution. The proposed approach is shown to be quite efficient; typically, for every ten time steps, one to two orders of magnitude reduction of the dispersion width of the plume can be attained. Furthermore, the method is shown to be asymptotically exact for reverse Fickian diffusion. The method is applied with success to several situations involving the diffusive transport of a conservative solute in the following cases: (i) Single source recovery in one-dimensional space with constant diffusion parameters (this example serves as a validation test for the theory); (ii) Single source recovery in two-dimensional space with constant isotropic diffusion (this example also serves as a test for the theory); (iii) Multiple source recovery in two-dimensional space, assuming isotropic diffusion. It is expected that the methodology tested in this paper is applicable more generally to complex environmental pollution problems involving multiple sources, anisotropic hydrodynamic dispersion, and space-time variable advection-diffusion flow systems; the modeling of reverse diffusion/dispersion in such systems is currently under investigation. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

In Puget Sound, Washington, {USA}, the degree to which shellfish rely on these different organic matter subsidies may be important for their management and that of nearshore food webs in general. We explored patterns of terrestrial-marine connectivity in a large, temperate estuary using a combination of oceanographic modeling and isotopic mixing models. We first examined spatial connectivity by modeling freshwater contributions of the major river basins to Puget Sound (potential connectivity), then estimated the relative contribution of terrestrial, nearshore, and marine organic matter sources to nearshore particulate organic matter ({POM}) (actual connectivity) and to the diets of Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas (realized connectivity). To estimate actual and realized connectivity, we analyzed the δ13C and δ15N values of oyster tissue, {POM}, and primary producers from intertidal, offshore, salt marsh, and upland habitats across the dry (summer) and wet (fall-winter) seasons. Mixing models indicated that both oyster bed {POM} and oyster diets were composed largely of intertidal macrophytes and salt marsh plants, with less important contributions of phytoplankton, benthic diatoms, and upland vegetation. Our findings suggest that oyster production may be driven more by coastal and marine primary production than by riverine sources, even in a fjord subject to strong freshwater influences.},

	abstract = {Modifications for navigation since the late 1800s have increased channel depth (H) in the lower Hudson River estuary by 10–30\%, and at the mouth the depth has more than doubled. Observations along the lower estuary show that both salinity and stratification have increased over the past century. Model results comparing predredging bathymetry from the 1860s with modern conditions indicate an increase in the salinity intrusion of about 30\%, which is roughly consistent with the H5/3 scaling expected from theory for salt flux dominated by steady exchange. While modifications including a recent deepening project have been concentrated near the mouth, the changes increase salinity and threaten drinking water supplies more than 100 km landward. The deepening has not changed the responses to river discharge (Qr) of the salinity intrusion ({\textasciitilde}Qr−1/3) or mean stratification (Qr2/3). Surprisingly, the increase in salinity intrusion with channel deepening results in almost no change in the estuarine circulation. This contrasts sharply with local scaling based on local dynamics of an H2 dependence, but it is consistent with a steady state salt balance that allows scaling of the estuarine circulation based on external forcing factors and is independent of depth. In contrast, the observed and modeled increases in stratification are opposite of expectations from the steady state balance, which could be due to reduction in mixing with loss of shallow subtidal regions. Overall, the mean shift in estuarine parameter space due to channel deepening has been modest compared with the monthly-to-seasonal variability due to tides and river discharge.},

	abstract = {{SYNOPSIS}. Non-indigenous species ({NIS}) are increasingly conspicuous in marine and estuarine habitats throughout the world, as the number, variety, and effects of these species continue to accrue. Most of these {NIS} invasions result from anthropogenic dispersal. Although the relative importance of different dispersal mechanisms varies both spatially and temporally, the global movement of ballast water by ships appears to be the largest single vector for {NIS} transfer today, and many recent invasions have resulted from this transfer. The rate of new invasions ' may have increased in recent decades, perhaps due to changes in ballast water transport. Estuaries have been especially common sites of invasions, accumulating from tens to hundreds of {NIS} per estuary that include most major taxonomic and trophic groups. We now know of approximately 400 {NIS} along the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the U.S., and hundreds of marine and estuarine {NIS} are reported from other regions of the world. Although available information about invasions is limited to a few regions and underestimates the actual number of {NIS} invasions, there are apparent differences in the frequency of {NIS} among sites. Mechanisms responsible for observed patterns among sites likely include variation in supply of {NIS}, and perhaps variation in properties of recipient or donor communities, but the role of these mechanisms has not been tested. Although our present knowledge about the extent, patterns and mechanisms of marine invasions is still in its infancy, it is clear that {NIS} are a significant force of change in marine and especially estuarine communities globally. Taxonomically diverse {NIS} are having significant effects on many, if not most, estuaries that fundamentally alter population, community, and ecosystems processes. The impacts of most {NIS} remain unknown, and the predictability of their direct and indirect effects remains uncertain. Nonetheless, based upon the documented extent of {NIS} invasions and scope of then effects, studies of marine communities that do not include {NIS} are increasingly incomplete.},

Particular organic and inorganic compounds, as well as organisms, carried seaward in rivers, are incorporated into marine food chains. Physical and biological characteristics of coastal waters reflect the seasonal and interannual variability of the incoming rivers. This includes the fisheries as interannual fluctuations in the yields of certain commercial fish species are found to covary with runoff.

Observational series have accumulated over the past 2-5 decades from measurements across the world's estuaries, bays, lagoons, inland seas and shelf waters influenced by runoff. We synthesize information contained in these time series to develop a global view of changes occurring in marine systems influenced by connectivity to land. Our review is organized around four themes: (i) human activities as drivers of change; (ii) variability of the climate system as a driver of change; (iii) successes, disappointments and challenges of managing change at the sea-land interface; and (iv) discoveries made from observations over time. Multidecadal time series reveal that many of the world's estuarine-coastal ecosystems are in a continuing state of change, and the pace of change is faster than we could have imagined a decade ago. Some have been transformed into novel ecosystems with habitats, biogeochemistry and biological communities outside the natural range of variability. Change takes many forms including linear and nonlinear trends, abrupt state changes and oscillations. The challenge of managing change is daunting in the coastal zone where diverse human pressures are concentrated and intersect with different responses to climate variability over land and over ocean basins. The pace of change in estuarine-coastal ecosystems will likely accelerate as the human population and economies continue to grow and as global climate change accelerates. Wise stewardship of the resources upon which we depend is critically dependent upon a continuing flow of information from observations to measure, understand and anticipate future changes along the world's coastlines.},

Based on the 21st century sea-level rise scenarios projected by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program ({CCSP}, 2009), the Chesapeake Bay was chosen as a prototype to study the responses of the estuary to potential future sea-level rise. The numerical model results show that the average salt content, salt intrusion length, and stratification will increase as sea level rises. The changes of these parameters have obvious seasonal and inter-annual variations. Both the salt content and stratification show more increase in spring (following the high-flow periods) and wet years than in autumn (following the low-flow periods) and dry years. The salt intrusion length has larger increase and greater standard deviation in autumn than in spring. The transport time scales are used to illustrate the variations of transport processes as sea level rises, and results indicate that (1) the exchange flow would be strengthened but the downstream transport of fresh water would be slower; (2) the residence time of the Bay would increase due to the increased volume and change of circulation; (3) the vertical transport time (reference to water surface) has more pronounced increase and the volume of water mass with different age groups increases with different rates. As a result, the retention time of dissolved substances in the Bay would increase. Although the increased tidal currents would strengthen the vertical mixing, the increased stratification would weaken the vertical exchange. The increase of vertical transport time is due to the impact of stratification changes, which overwhelms the impact of tidal changes. As the bottom dissolved oxygen ({DO}) supply is predominated by the vertical exchanges in the Chesapeake Bay, the increased upstream transport time has a weak impact on hypoxia conditions in the middle and upper portions of the Bay. The weakened vertical exchange would result in less {DO} supply from the surface to the bottom layer. © 2012.},

	abstract = {A model for nutrient uptake rate (V) in phytoplankton is derived: V = {nAvS}/(1 + {hAvS}) where n is cellular number of uptake sites, A is area of the uptake site, h is time required for handling one nutrient ion, v is the mass transfer coefficient, and S is substrate concentration. The model is based on 2 time requirements necessary for active uptake of nutrients: (i) time required for realizing encounters with nutrient ions and (ii) time necessary for handling of ions. The Michaelis-Menten model applied to algal nutrient uptake is a special case of the proposed model, and shortcomings of this model are discussed in view of the more general model. While maximum uptake rate (Vmax = nh−1) may be considered as a parameter reflecting solely biological constraints, the half-saturation (Ks = {hAv})−1) and affinity (α = {nAv}) depend on both biological and physical constraints. Interrelations between maximum uptake rate, half-saturation constant and affinity are demonstrated and discussed with reference to actual observations. On the basis of the model we hypothesize that maximum uptake rate should increase linearly with the square of cell radius, while half-saturation constant and affinity should increase linearly with cell radius. Furthermore, maximum uptake rate should increase exponentially with temperature, while half-saturation should also increase with temperature, but at a slower rate than maximum uptake rate. Affinity should increase with temperature in the same way as molecular diffusion does.},

In this paper, we explore the inter- and intra-annual variability of freshwater flow to this estuary and the resulting salt intrusion under scenarios that represent pre-development and contemporary conditions. To place this comparison in context with the advent of systematic and accurate flow and salinity measurements in the estuary, we consider an additional "pre-project" scenario that represents early 20th-century water management (circa 1920), after major flood control and reclamation but before the introduction of large water storage, diversion, and export operations. We use an observed climate record that spans 82 years to compare freshwater flow associated with the scenarios' landscape and water use characteristics. Using published relationships between flow and salt intrusion length developed from three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling, we evaluate the effect of these flow alterations as well as estuarine geometry modifications and historically observed sea level rise on salt intrusion. We conclude that the predevelopment estuary exhibited a more seasonally variable salinity regime, resulting from a more variable inflow regime from the upstream watershed.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter briefly describes the decomposition and pedogenesis concept. Decomposition is the breakdown of dead organic matter that eventually results in release of {CO}2, other organic trace gases, water, mineral nutrients, and energy. Pedogenesis (soil development) largely reflects the activities of animals, including those involved in decomposition, that mix organic matter with mineral soil. These two processes contribute greatly to the capacity of a site to support primary production. Decomposition and pedogenesis are major ecosystem processes that affect biogeochemical cycling, trace gas fluxes, soil fertility, and primary production. Decomposition can be categorized into four component processes: photo-oxidation, the abiotic catabolism resulting from exposure to solar radiation; leaching, the loss of soluble materials as a result of percolation of water through material; comminution, the fragmentation of organic litter, largely as a result of detritivory; and mineralization, the catabolism of organic molecules by microorganisms. This chapter describes the types, effects, and patterns of detritivory and burrowing very briefly. Decomposition generally can be modeled as a multiple negative exponential decay function over time, with decay constants proportional to the quality of litter components.},

Except where cover is absent, and in-stream gross primary production is {\textgreater}1 {gC} m–2 day–1 and ratios of produc- tion to respiration are {\textgreater}1, riparian sources dominate carbon pools in catchment streams. On floodplains, primary production by river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) forests is {\textasciitilde}600 {gC} m–2 year–1. Total primary production by aquatic macrophytes and biofilms in floodplain wetlands is {\textgreater}2500 {gC} m–2 year–1 and {\textgreater}620 {gC} m–2 year–1, respectively. Large pools of particulate organic carbon ({POC}) exist on flood- plains as litter ({\textgreater}500 {gC} m–2) and coarse woody debris ({\textasciitilde}6 {kgC} m–2). Floods may release 50 {gDOC} m–2 from leaf litter. Export of this {DOC} (dissolved organic carbon) may be substantial relative to autochthonous production in river channels. Sediments deposited on floodplains during large floods rep- resent a substantial sink of riverine {POC} (up to 280 {gC} m–2). Bacteria are responsible for rapid decom- position of {DOC} and {POC} in floodplain wetlands (sediment respiration and methanogenesis, both {\textasciitilde}1 {gC} m–2 day–1). Flow and its interaction with geomorphology control carbon fluxes in rivers. Decreased inputs of floodplain carbon, following river regulation and physical disturbances to catchments and floodplains, may have resulted in many Australian rivers being dominated by algal production.},

	abstract = {Enhancement projects within anadromous salmonid rivers of California have increased in recent years. Much of this work is intended as mitigation in regulated streams where salmon and steelhead spawning habitat is inaccessible or degraded due to dams, water diversions and channelization. Little research has been done to assess the benefits of spawning habitat enhancement to stream organisms other than salmon. We monitored benthic macroinvertebrates at seven spawning gravel augmentation sites in the lower Mokelumne River, a regulated stream in the Central Valley of California. Placement of cleaned floodplain gravel decreased depths and increased stream velocities. Benthic organisms colonized new gravels quickly, equalling densities and biomass of unenhanced spawning sites within 4 weeks. Macroinvertebrate species richness equalled that of unenhanced sites within 4 weeks and diversity within 2 weeks. Standing crop, as indicated by densities and dry biomass, was significantly higher in enhancement sites after 12 weeks than in unenhanced sites and remained so over the following 10 weeks. Although mobile collector/browsers initially dominated new gravels, sedentary collectors were the most common feeding category after 4 weeks, similar to unenhanced sites. These data suggest that cleaned gravels from adjacent floodplain materials, used to enhance salmonid spawning sites, are quickly incorporated into the stream ecosystem, benefiting benthic macroinvertebrate densities and dry biomass.

As the largest estuary in the {US}, the Chesapeake Bay has been the focus of one of the most high-profile restoration programs ever undertaken in North America. While the primary emphasis has been on tidal waters, freshwater tributary clean-up strategies have recently been developed. We have compiled the first comprehensive database of over 4700 existing river and stream restoration projects in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed ({CBW}) to examine where dollars are being spent, what issues motivate restoration, and what approaches are used. By conservative estimates, in excess of \$400 million has been invested in restoration projects since 1990. The majority of projects were implemented to restore forest vegetation in riparian areas and improve water quality. Although the {CBW} has an extremely high density of restoration activities relative to other regions of the {US}, only 5.4\% of the project records indicated that related monitoring of project performance has occurred. To provide cost-effective management solutions, we recommend that a centralized tracking system be developed that includes restoration projects associated with both tidal and non-tidal waterways, along with a substantial increase in investment in the comprehensive monitoring of individual projects following implementation. © The Ecological Society of America.},

We studied temporal and spatial variations in fluorescence index ({FI}) and specific {UV} absorbance ({SUVA}) of {DOM} to identify {DOM} sources and fate during the flood. Dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) concentrations ranged from 2 to 25 mg C L-1 in channels of the Delta, with seasonal floodplains having consistently higher concentrations. Chemical indices, such as {DOC} concentrations, conductivity, specific {UV} absorbance ({SUVA}), fluorescence, total dissolved nitrogen, and chlorophyll a, were analyzed for channel and floodplain sites in the Seasonal Swamp. {DOC} concentrations increased during the rising limb of the flood in the Seasonal Swamp. {SUVA} of whole water samples and fluorescence index ({FI}) of fulvic acids isolated from channel and floodplain sites changed in a manner indicating the release of {DOM} by leaching of plant litter during the flood. After the flood receded, {DOC} concentrations and fulvic acid content decreased, and microbially-derived sources of organic matter dominated. Along two river reaches, measuring over 400 km each, variations in {DOC} concentrations were primarily due to geomorphology, with the effects of the annual flood overprinted atop the spatial controls. Increasing downstream {DOC} concentrations were found to be a product of inundation of {DOC}-rich seasonal floodplains and evaporation-enriched waters downstream. Increasing {SUVA}, dissolved nitrogen, and fulvic acid content, and decreasing {FI} downstream suggested microbial processing of terrestrial {DOM} and possible release of nutrients incorporated in the {DOM}. © 2005, The Society of Wetland Scientists.},

Although floodplains support high levels of biodiversity and some of the most productive ecosystems on Earth, they are also among the most converted and threatened ecosystems and therefore have recently become the focus of conservation and restoration programs across the United States and globally. These efforts seek to conserve or restore complex, highly variable ecosystems and often must simultaneously address both land and water management. Thus, such efforts must overcome considerable scientific, technical, and socioeconomic challenges. In addition to proposing a scientific conceptual model, this paper also includes three case studies that illustrate methods for addressing these technical and socioeconomic challenges within projects that seek to promote ecologically functional floodplains through river-floodplain reconnection and / or restoration of key components of hydrological variability. © 2010 American Water Resources Association.},

Thus, it is rarely possible to "restore" pre-disturbance conditions; rather restoration programs (even large, well-funded ones) will nearly always involve multiple small projects, each of which can make some modest change to selected ecosystem processes and habitats. At present, such projects are typically selected based on their attributes as individual projects (e.g., consistency with programmatic goals of the funders, scientific soundness, and acceptance by local communities), and ease of implementation. Projects are rarely prioritized (at least explicitly) based on how they will cumulatively affect ecosystem function over coming decades. Such projections require an understanding of the form of the restoration response curve, or at least that we assume some plausible relations and estimate cumulative effects based thereon. Drawing on our experience with the {CALFED} Bay-Delta Ecosystem Restoration Program in California, we consider potential cumulative system-wide benefits of a restoration activity extensively implemented in the region: isolating/filling abandoned floodplain gravel pits captured by rivers to reduce predation of outmigrating juvenile salmon by exotic warmwater species inhabiting the pits. We present a simple spreadsheet model to show how different assumptions about gravel pit bathymetry and predator behavior would affect the cumulative benefits of multiple pit-filling and isolation projects, and how these insights could help managers prioritize which pits to fill. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, {LLC}.},

Globally, riverine flood plains cover {\textgreater} 2 × 106km2, however, they are among the most threatened ecosystems. Floodplain degradation is closely linked to the rapid decline in freshwater biodiversity; the main reasons for the latter being habitat alteration, flow and flood control, species invasion and pollution. In Europe and North America, up to 90\% of flood plains are already 'cultivated' and therefore functionally extinct. In the developing world, the remaining natural flood plains are disappearing at an accelerating rate, primarily as a result of changing hydrology. Up to the 2025 time horizon, the future increase of human population will lead to further degradation of riparian areas, intensification of the hydrological cycle, increase in the discharge of pollutants, and further proliferation of species invasions. In the near future, the most threatened flood plains will be those in south-east Asia, Sahelian Africa and North America. There is an urgent need to preserve existing, intact flood plain rivers as strategic global resources and to begin to restore hydrologic dynamics, sediment transport and riparian vegetation to those rivers that retain some level of ecological integrity.

However, information about their response to ambient flow has remained elusive, because of the difficulties of following the individual motions of these minute, nearly transparent animals in the ocean. Using a three-dimensional acoustic imaging system, we tracked {\textgreater}375,000 zooplankters at two coastal sites in the Red Sea, Resolution of their motion from that of the water showed that the animals effectively maintained their depth by swimming against upwelling and down-welling currents moving at rates of up to tens of body lengths per second, causing their accumulation at frontal zones. This mechanism explains how oceanic fronts become major feeding grounds for predators and targets for fishermen.},

	abstract = {The papers in this special issue feature state-of-the-art approaches to understanding the physical processes related to sediment transport and geomorphology of complex coastal–estuarine systems. Here we focus on the San Francisco Bay Coastal System, extending from the lower San Joaquin–Sacramento Delta, through the Bay, and along the adjacent outer Paciﬁc Coast. San Francisco Bay is an urbanized estuary that is impacted by numerous anthropogenic activities common to many large estuaries, including a mining legacy, channel dredging, aggregate mining, reservoirs, freshwater diversion, watershed modiﬁcations, urban run-off, ship trafﬁc, exotic species introductions, land reclamation, and wetland restoration. The Golden Gate strait is the sole inlet connecting the Bay to the Paciﬁc Ocean, and serves as the conduit for a tidal ﬂow of {\textasciitilde}8 × 109 m3/day, in addition to the transport of mud, sand, biogenic material, nutrients, and pollutants. Despite this physical, biological and chemical connection, resource management and prior research have often treated the Delta, Bay and adjacent ocean as separate entities, compartmentalized by artiﬁcial geographic or political boundaries. The body of work herein presents a comprehensive analysis of system-wide behavior, extending a rich heritage of sediment transport research that dates back to the groundbreaking hydraulic mining-impact research of G.K. Gilbert in the early 20th century.},

The radiative input is required to predict non-gravitational tides, and it allows for the essential distinction that the Earth is opaque to radiation and transparent to gravitation.},

	doi = {10.25607/OBP-191},
	abstract = {The purpose of this book is to provide the reader with the knowledge required to carry out the most accurate tidal analysis and tidal prediction possible using any set of water level or current data that he or she may have available. The book is also intended to provide the reader with tools to interpret the analysis results with respect to the hydrodynamics (the physics of the water movement) of the bay or ocean from which the data were obtained, so that these results can best be used for particular oceanographic applications. Tidal analysis and prediction involves more than simply running a harmonic analysis program to obtain tidal harmonic constants and then putting them in a tidal prediction program. It requires understanding both the astronomical and the hydrodynamic aspects of the tide. Lack of such an understanding can lead to problems when performing a tidal analysis. A few examples of such problems are very briefly mentioned below (they are explained in more detail later in this book, and the technical terms used below are defined in Chapter 2). It is the astronomy, namely the relative periodic motions of the earth, moon, and sun, that determines the frequencies at which tidal energy is found. The contribution to the tide by the energy at each tidal frequency is usually represented by a tidal harmonic constituent, for which there will be an amplitude and a phase lag. The pairs of amplitudes and phase lags are referred to as harmonic constants. Which of these tidal constituents can be included in a harmonic analysis depends on the length of the data times series one has available. The longer the time series the more tidal constituents that can be included in the analysis and the more accurate the tidal predictions will be. Attempting to include in the analysis more tidal constituents than can be resolved with the available length of the time series can lead to erroneous results, or even to no results at all because in such cases numerical instability can cause the harmonic analysis program to fail ( “blow up”). Even when the appropriate tidal constituents are included in a harmonic analysis, one must remember that the energy of the tidal constituents that could not be included in the harmonic analysis (because they were too close in frequency to other larger tidal constituents) will still affect the constituents that were included in the analysis. As a result one may see errors, namely, differences between the tide predictions and the actual water level data, that slowly oscillate in time due to the missing tidal constituents. Such errors may be significant if one has analyzed only 15 days of data or even 29 days. It is the hydrodynamics of the ocean and bay that determines how large the tide or tidal current will be at a particular location, as well as the timing of high and low waters, maximum floods and ebbs, and slack waters. In shallow water the hydrodynamics becomes nonlinear, distorting the tide and adding new higher harmonic tidal constituents (overtides) and new tidal constituents within the semidiurnal tidal band (compound tides), some with the same frequencies as some of the original astronomically caused tidal constituents. Knowing whether an analyzed constituent is a compound Tidal Analysis and Prediction 2 tidal constituent or an astronomical tidal constituent (with the same frequency) can make a difference in the accuracy of the subsequent tide predictions, especially when making predictions for years other than the year whose data was used for the analysis. Shallow-water hydrodynamics also causes nonlinear interactions between the tide and nontidal phenomena such as river flow and wind-produced changes in water level (storm surges) and currents. For example, high river flow reduces the tide range and distorts the tide curve (modifying the astronomical tidal constituents and adding additional higher harmonic constituents, the overtides). And so, if water level data obtained during a time period with high river flow are analyzed and then tide predictions are made using the harmonic constants derived from those data, the predicted high waters will be too small throughout the rest of the year. Likewise data obtained during strong wind events may have tides that are modified by low-frequency storm surge and thus are not representative of the rest of the year. In most cases water level or current data are only available at a few distinct locations in a bay or along a coast. Often some of these locations have data times series that are not long enough to allow a useful harmonic analysis, so oceanographers developed other ways to extract tidal information from locations with short data time series. For decades this has been done nonharmonically, by simply comparing the high and low waters in water level data from the short stations (usually called subordinate stations, or secondary ports) with the high and low waters in predictions harmonically derived from longer stations (usually called reference stations, or standard ports). However, there can be severe limitations on how well this can work, due to the hydrodynamics of the location where the data were obtained. Although this book provides some “rules of thumb” for carrying out tidal analysis and prediction, the intent is to go well beyond this. This book explains not just the “how” but also the “why”, namely it provides explanations of the astronomical causes of the tide and the hydrodynamic modifications of the tide, so the reader can determine how to maximize the accuracy of the analysis results and predictions. This understanding is also important for interpreting the analysis results. This book explains and illustrates all state-of-the-art tidal analysis and prediction methods presently in use, as well as the astronomical, hydrodynamic, and statistical theories behind them. This is not intended to be a complete textbook on tides. The emphasis here is on subjects the reader must understand in order to carry out accurate tidal analyses and to make skillful tidal predictions. However, in meeting this objective, the result is a reasonably complete study of the tides (with references for subjects not covered in detail). The book provides practical operational procedures, including considerations related to maximum analysis accuracy and maximum prediction skill. The book is written at an introductory level, so that the reader should need little background in tidal or oceanographic theory. With an eye toward the teaching aspects of this book, it begins with a general overview of the subject of tides, so that the reader can first see the big picture. Then as the material becomes more detailed, the reader will be able to understand that material within a larger context. Since the astronomical and hydrodynamic aspects of the subject affect each other, it was felt that such an overview should be given first, rather than simply jumping right into detailed astronomical theory followed by detailed hydrodynamic theory. Because of this approach, there may occasionally be some redundancy, as well as frequent references to other sections in the book. Although this book is written at a level accessible to the nonexpert, it is also hoped that tidal experts will still find of interest some of the topics that they may not have dealt with themselves.},

	abstract = {Coupled biological/physical models of marine systems serve many purposes including the synthesis of information, hypothesis generation, and as a tool for numerical experimentation. However, marine system models are increasingly used for prediction to support high-stakes decision-making. In such applications it is imperative that a rigorous model skill assessment is conducted so that the model's capabilities are tested and understood. Herein, we review several metrics and approaches useful to evaluate model skill. The deﬁnition of skill and the determination of the skill level necessary for a given application is context speciﬁc and no single metric is likely to reveal all aspects of model skill. Thus, we recommend the use of several metrics, in concert, to provide a more thorough appraisal. The routine application and presentation of rigorous skill assessment metrics will also serve the broader interests of the modeling community, ultimately resulting in improved forecasting abilities as well as helping us recognize our limitations.},

The former test case, or twin experiment, validates the use of the {EM} algorithm and Bayesian Information Criterion with Gaussian Mixture Models in a ﬁltering context; the latter further exempliﬁes its ability to eﬃciently handle state vectors of non-trivial dimensionality and dynamics with jets and eddies. For each test case, qualitative and quantitative comparisons are made with contemporary ﬁlters. The sensitivity to input parameters is illustrated and discussed. Properties of the ﬁlter are examined and its estimates are described, including: the equation-based and adaptive prediction of the probability densities; the evolution of the mean ﬁeld, stochastic subspace modes and stochastic coeﬃcients; the ﬁtting of Gaussian Mixture Models; and, the eﬃcient and analytical Bayesian updates at assimilation times and the corresponding data impacts. The advantages of respecting nonlinear dynamics and preserving non-Gaussian statistics are brought to light. For realistic test cases admitting complex distributions and with sparse or noisy measurements, the {GMM}-{DO} ﬁlter is shown to fundamentally improve the ﬁltering skill, outperforming simpler schemes invoking the Gaussian parametric distribution.},

	abstract = {High resolution airborne laser data provide new ways to explore the role of topographic complexity in hydraulic modelling parameterisation, taking into account the scale-dependency between roughness and topography. In this paper, a complex topography from {LiDAR} is processed using a spatially and temporally distributed method at a ﬁne resolution. The surface topographic parameterisation considers the sub-grid {LiDAR} data points above and below a reference {DEM}, hereafter named as topographic content. A method for roughness parameterisation is developed based on the topographic content included in the topographic {DEM}. Five subscale parameterisation schemes are generated (topographic contents at 0, ± 5, ± 10, ± 25 and ± 50 cm) and roughness values are calculated using an equation based on the mixing layer theory (Katul et al., 2002), resulting in a co-varied relationship between roughness height and topographic content. Variations in simulated ﬂow across spatial subscales show that the sub grid-scale behaviour of the 2-D model is not well-reﬂected in the topographic content of the {DEM} and that subscale parameterisation must be modelled through a spatially distributed roughness parameterisation. Variations in ﬂow predictions are related to variations in the roughness parameter. Flow depth-derived results do not change systematically with variation in roughness height or topographic content but they respond to their interaction. Finally, subscale parameterisation modiﬁes primarily the spatial structure (level of organisation) of simulated 2-D ﬂow linearly with the additional complexity of subscale parameterisation.},

	abstract = {The calibration of partially submerged radial and vertical-sluice gates has proven difficult to determine under field conditions. In a recent paper, the author and colleagues developed a method for determining the calibration of radial gates from free flow to submerged flow, continuously through the transition. The method uses the energy equation on the upstream side of the vena contracta and the momentum equation on the downstream side, and thus has been named the energy- momentum or {EM} method. Because of the nature of the partially submerged jet, an empirical energy correction is needed during partial submergence. One advantage of the method is the ability to account for a wide variety of downstream conditions, including channels that are significantly wider than the gates. It was anticipated that the method would allow estimation of discharge based only on gate openings and upstream and downstream water levels, even for multiple gates with different openings. However, if one gate is free- flowing and another in the transition zone, estimation of discharge is complicated by lateral flow, and may become intractable. One solution is to measure the downstream pressure in the vena contracta. With the energy correction term, this measurement avoids the need for use of the momentum equation downstream.},

With the advent of higher-frequency measurements from cabled coastal ocean observatories, current data also include supertidal variability (ﬂuctuation) associated with a variety of turbulent and internal wave processes. To examine the relationships of such ﬂuctuations to variability of the tides and/or potentially time-variable mean ﬂows within which they are embedded, it is highly desirable to ﬁnd a method whereby these ﬂow components can be separated over relatively short periods of intensiﬁed event-scale forcing. A method is presented that ﬁrst isolates ‘‘ﬂuctuations’’ and then separates the remaining longer time-scale variability into ‘‘tides’’ and a remaining ‘‘mean,’’ without recourse to extraction of a ﬁtted tide with the error inherent in such a ﬁt over short data records.},

	abstract = {The Yellow Sea ({YS}) is highly stratified seasonally due to the presence of the bottom cold water ({BCW}), also called the {YS} Cold Water Mass ({YSCWM}). Intermittent measurements from June 2009 to August 2014 show that the near-inertial oscillation ({NIO}) can be excited by synoptic weather systems during the presence of the {YSCWM} between March and October. The magnitude of the {NIOs} depends on both the wind work and the water strat­ ification. Thus, extreme wind events, such as tropical cyclones, destratify the shallow water and are unfavorable for {NIOs}. In general, the {NIO} induced by individual synoptic system is weak, but the event occurred from 6 to 22 July 2009 excited by four extratropical cyclones can result in a near-inertial current speed of 0.3 ms− 1. The average wind work during this event was 1.32 × 10− 3 Wm− 2, and estimates of 42.67 {MW} energy transferred from wind into the {YS} during this event. However, only 6.1\%{\textasciitilde}8.4\% of the wind work can be transited into the {BCW} interior. Budget analysis indicates most energy is dissipated to mix the highly stratified water rather than damped by the bottom friction. The {NIO} frequency blueshift in the vertical also indicates higher energy dissi­ pation between different layers. The decline of the {YSCWM} weakens the vertical stratification and thus the growth of {NIOs}. The calculation of wind work depends on the computation of wind drag coefficient and the conversion from wind measured height to 10 m above surface. In general, there is about 10\% difference on wind work by using different methods.},

	abstract = {Internal waves in the semidiurnal and near-inertial bands are investigated using an array of seven moorings located over the Reykjanes Ridge in a cross-ridge direction (57.68–59.18N, 28.58–33.38W). Continuous measurements of horizontal velocity and temperature for more than 2 years allow us to estimate the kinetic energy density and the energy ﬂuxes of the waves. We found that there is a remarkable phase locking and linear relationship between the semidiurnal energy density and the tidal energy conversion at the spring–neap cycle. The energy-to-conversion ratio gives replenishment time scales of 4–5 days on the ridge top versus 7–9 days on the ﬂanks. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the bulk of the tidal energy on the ridge comes from near-local sources, with a redistribution of energy from the top to the ﬂanks, which is endorsed by the energy ﬂuxes oriented in the cross-ridge direction. Implications for tidally driven energy dissipation are discussed. The time-averaged near-inertial kinetic energy is smaller than the semidiurnal kinetic energy by a factor of 2–3 but is much more variable in time. It features a strong seasonal cycle with a winter intensiﬁcation and subseasonal peaks associated with local wind bursts. The ratio of energy to wind work gives replenishment time scales of 13–15 days, which is consistent with the short time scales of observed variability of near-inertial energy. In the upper ocean (1 km), the highest levels of near-inertial energy are preferentially found in anticyclonic structures, with a twofold increase relative to cyclonic structures, illustrating the funneling effect of anticyclones.},

But general description of adjustable windows for any window length are always deficient in time domain and frequency domian. Moreover, there lacks quantitative comparison of spectral characteristics among adjustable windows. In this paper, analytic expressions that suit for any window length were utilized to describe adjustable windows, including the Kaiser, Cosh, Dolph-Chebyshev, Saramäki and other ultraspherical windows. The spectral characteristics of adjustable windows were obtained through numerical computation, and their curves were numerically fitted with simple functions about adjustable parameters. The relative deviations between the computed curves and the fitted ones are normally less than 7 percent. Finally, detail comparison of spectral characteristics among adjustable windows were performed from multi-sides. It shows that the Saramäki window has better overall performance than other adjustable windows by comparing spectral characteristics.},

The tidal currents arerelatively smallthrough much of the study area. Offshore, the largest of both the diurnaland the semi-diurnaltidal currents were in allcases less than 8 c d s in amplitude. In nearshore locations, the tidal currents can be considerably stronger due to internal tides; for example, off Cape Hay on Bylot Island, the {KItidal} currents near the surface were determined to have an amplitudeof 15 c d s . Evidence of inertial oscillations was present in the recordsfrom the uppermost current meters on allmooringslocated at a nominaldepth of 35m. Typicalamplitudes were 10to 20c d s , with speeds as high as 35 c d s being observed. The magnitude of inertial oqcillations decreases rapidly with depth; at 250 m, they are greatly reduced in amplitude and are difficult to resolve from the semi-diurnaltidal currents. Theinertial oscillations resulted, in large part, from changes in the local surface wind; at times of solid ice cover, their amplitudes were markedly reduced.},

The observed near-inertial or diurnal oscillations are very intermittent in time and have a time scale of about 10 inertial periods. Using a simple slab model of wind-driven inertial currents, we show that their temporal variations are related to the fluctuations in the local wind stress field. Three events of strong (20 em S-I) near-inertial/diurnal motions are studied in detail. Two events at the diurnal frequency occur on the continental shelf. For the first, the observed subinertial oscillations are interpreted as continental shelf waves generated by the diurnal tide currents and the local winds. For the second, observations are consistent with wind-driven internal waves. A third event of near-inertial oscillations appears for most of the drifters in the wake of a tropical storm. The vorticity of the background mesoscale circulation shifts the frequency of the wind-generated oscillations by as much as ±0.05 cpd.},

Previous studies mostly focused on developing new surrogate models and/or applying existing surrogate models to practical problems. Despite the computational efﬁciency, the surrogate for a new task is often built from scratch and the knowledge gained from previous surrogate modelling for similar tasks is neglected. As the need for quickly modifying simulation models to reﬂect design changes has signiﬁcantly increased, one potential solution is to utilize prior knowledge from surrogate modelling. In this study, a novel meta-learning-based surrogate modelling framework is presented. The framework includes two phases: a meta-training and a fewshot learning phase. A meta-model that represents a family of tasks and the adaptation of this model to a new task with few data points are the results of the ﬁrst and second phase, respectively. The study speciﬁes the scope of the framework by classifying similar tasks. Applications of the framework to global sensitivity analysis, optimization, and reliability analysis are also addressed. Four numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the framework.},

            Surrogate models have several uses in engineering design, including speeding up design optimization, noise reduction, test measurement interpolation, gradient estimation, portability, and protection of intellectual property. Traditionally, surrogate models require that all training data conform to the same parametrization (e.g., design variables), limiting design freedom and prohibiting the reuse of historical data. In response, this article proposes graph-based surrogate models ({GSMs}) for trusses. The {GSM} can accurately predict displacement fields from static loads given the structure’s geometry as input, enabling training across multiple parametrizations. {GSMs} build upon recent advancements in geometric deep learning, which have led to the ability to learn on undirected graphs: a natural representation for trusses. To further promote flexible surrogate models, this article explores transfer learning within the context of engineering design and demonstrates positive knowledge transfer across data sets of different topologies, complexities, loads, and applications, resulting in more flexible and data-efficient surrogate models for trusses.},

We present a novel method, the Lidar Elevation Adjustment with {NDVI} ({LEAN}), to correct lidar digital elevation models ({DEMs}) with vegetation indices from readily available multispectral airborne imagery ({NAIP}) and {RTK}-{GPS} surveys. Using 17 study sites along the Paciﬁc coast of the U.S., we achieved an average root mean squared error ({RMSE}) of 0.072 m, with a 40–75\% improvement in accuracy from the lidar bare earth {DEM}. Results from our method compared favorably with results from three other methods (minimum-bin gridding, mean error correction, and vegetation correction factors), and a power analysis applying our extensive {RTK}-{GPS} dataset showed that on average 118 points were necessary to calibrate a site-speciﬁc correction model for tidal marshes along the Paciﬁc coast. By using available imagery and with minimal ﬁeld surveys, we showed that lidar-derived {DEMs} can be adjusted for greater accuracy while maintaining high (1 m) resolution.},

These flows, which are partially obstructed by a permeable medium, are here termed ‘obstructed shear flows’. Examples include aquatic flows over sediment beds, submerged vegetation canopies and coral reefs, as well as atmospheric flows over crop canopies, forests and cities (‘urban canopies’). While the density and geometry of the obstructions may vary, the drag in each system generates a velocity profile with an inflection point. This renders the flow unstable. Consequently, it is expected that (
              a
              ) the dominant interfacial turbulent structure in obstructed shear flows will be a Kelvin–Helmholtz-type vortex, and (
              b
              ) that this instability will engender hydrodynamic similarities among obstructed shear flows. Such similarities have been hypothesized but not yet fully explored. An extensive review of existing data confirms these dynamic similarities on scales of

              O

Other relationships that link the strength of turbulence and the ‘slip’ velocity at the top of the obstruction to the friction velocity (

	abstract = {Prevalence of vegetation (either submerged or emergent) in shallow water significantly affects the flow and turbulence structure in this environment. In this paper, we develop a new 3D unstructured grid hydrostatic model that accounts for the 3D effects of vegetation on flows. The model uses a semi-implicit time stepping method and treats the new vegetation-related terms implicitly to enhance numerical stability, so the time step does not need to be reduced as compared with the no-vegetation cases. The stability is also independent of the vegetation parameters, so as to efficiently account for large shear that can occur around the canopy. We validate the model using lab data before applying it to a field study in San Francisco Bay-Delta to illustrate the influence of the vegetation on the flow structure as well as tidal energetics. The efficiency of the model enabled by the implicit method allows, for the first time, the simulation of the vegetation effects during multi-year evolution of vegetation in full three dimensions at large spatial scales.},

	abstract = {A novel tidal analysis package (red\_tide) has been developed to characterize low-amplitude non-phase-locked tidal energy and dominant tidal peaks in noisy, irregularly sampled, or gap-prone time series. We recover tidal information by expanding conventional harmonic analysis to include prior information and assumptions about the statistics of a process, such as the assumption of a spectrally colored background, treated as nontidal noise. This is implemented using Bayesian maximum posterior estimation and assuming Gaussian prior distributions. We utilize a hierarchy of test cases, including synthetic data and observations, to evaluate this method and its relevance to analysis of data with a tidal component and an energetic nontidal background. Analysis of synthetic test cases shows that the methodology provides robust tidal estimates. When the background energy spectrum is nearly spectrally white, red\_tide results replicate results from ordinary least squares ({OLS}) commonly used in other tidal packages. When background spectra are red (a spectral slope of 22 or steeper), red\_tide’s estimates represent a measurable improvement over {OLS}. The approach highlights the presence of tidal variability and lowamplitude constituents in observations by allowing arbitrarily conﬁgurable ﬁtted frequencies and prior statistics that constrain solutions. These techniques have been implemented in {MATLAB} in order to analyze tidal data with non-phase-locked components and an energetic background that pose challenges to the commonly used {OLS} approach.},

The tidal signal can either be discarded, or its characteristics described in some fashion useful for further analysis. Although tidal signals can be removed by standard high or bandpass ﬁltering techniques, their relatively deterministic character and large amplitude make special techniques more effective. In classical harmonic analysis, the tidal signal is modelled as the sum of a ﬁnite set of sinusoids at speciﬁc frequencies related to astronomical parameters. A set of programs has been written in {MATLAB} to (a) perform classical harmonic analysis for periods of about 1 year or shorter, (b) account for (some) unresolved constituents using nodal corrections, and (c) compute conﬁdence intervals for the analyzed components. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Many complex real-world systems can be accurately modeled by simulations. However, high-ﬁdelity simulations may take hours or even days to compute. Because this can be impractical, a surrogate model is often used to approximate the dynamic behavior of the original simulator. This model can then be used as a cheap, drop-in replacement for the simulator. Because simulations can be very expensive, the data points, which are required to build the model, must be chosen as optimally as possible. Sequential design strategies oﬀer a huge advantage over one-shot experimental designs because they can use information gathered from previous data points in order to determine the location of new data points. Each sequential design strategy must perform a trade-oﬀ between exploration and exploitation, where the former involves selecting data points in unexplored regions of the design space, while the latter suggests adding data points in regions which were previously identiﬁed to be interesting (for example, highly nonlinear regions). In this paper, a novel hybrid sequential design strategy is proposed which uses a Monte Carlo–based approximation of a Voronoi tessellation for exploration and local linear approximations of the simulator for exploitation. The advantage of this method over other sequential design methods is that it is independent of the model type, and can therefore be used in heterogeneous modeling environments, where multiple model types are used at the same time. The new method is demonstrated on a number of test problems, showing that it is a robust, competitive, and eﬃcient sequential design strategy.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a method for constructing optimal design of experiments ({DoE}) intended for building surrogate models using dimensionless (or non-dimensional) variables. In order to increase the fidelity of the model obtained by regression, the {DoE} needs to optimally cover the dimensionless space. However, in order to generate the data for the regression, one still needs a {DoE} for the physical variables, in order to carry out the simulations. Thus, there exist two spaces, each one needing a {DoE}. Since the dimensionless space is always smaller than the physical one, the challenge for building a {DoE} is that the relation between the two spaces is not bijective. Moreover, each space usually has its own domain constraints, which renders them not-surjective. This means that it is impossible to design the {DoE} in one space and then automatically generate the corresponding {DoE} in the other space while satisfying the constraints from both spaces. The solution proposed in the paper transforms the computation of the {DoE} into an optimization problem formulated in terms of a space-filling criterion (maximizing the minimum distance between neighboring points). An approach is proposed for efficiently solving this optimization problem in a two steps procedure. The method is particularly well suited for building surrogates in terms of dimensionless variables spanning several orders of magnitude (e.g. power laws). The paper also proposes some variations of the method; one when more control is needed on the number of levels on each nondimensional variable and another one when a good distribution of the {DoE} is desired in the logarithmic scale. The {DoE} construction method is illustrated on three case studies. A purely numerical case illustrates each step of the method and two other, mechanical and thermal, case studies illustrate the results in different configurations and different practical aspects.},

Although introductory in its early sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective. Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and references at the end of the book"--},

Adopting an approach that is typical of functional data analysis, we propose a spatial spline regression model that is computationally efficient, allows for spatially distributed covariate information and can impose various conditions over the boundaries of the domain. Accurate surface estimation is achieved by the use of piecewise linear and quadratic finite elements},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of analyzing spatially distributed data characterized by spatial anisotropy. Following a functional data analysis approach, we propose a method based on regression with partial differential regularization, where the differential operator in the regularizing term is anisotropic and is derived from data. We show that the method correctly identifies the direction and intensity of anisotropy and returns an accurate estimate of the spatial field. The method compares favorably to both isotropic and anisotropic kriging, as tested in simulation studies under various scenarios. The method is then applied to the analysis of Switzerland rainfall data.},

	abstract = {The harmonic development of the tide-generating potential is the basis of most work on tidal observations, and since 1883 the development given by Sir G. H. Darwin has been universally used and has been of remarkable value. But discrepancies between prediction and observation are serious and have been attributed to faulty “harmonic constants”; it has been assumed that if these were improved better predictions would be obtained, and it has also been tacitly assumed that it is only necessary to consider the harmonic constituents as given by Darwin. Recent work, however, especially at the Tidal Institute, has shown that when all the “Darwinian constituents” are removed from the tidal height there is a residue composed of constituents which are not included in his schedules. These are such that any slight improvements possible in the “constants” usually obtained are comparatively negligible. The obvious course, therefore, was to make a more thorough development of the potential, and in view of the unknown nature of the residues great accuracy was obviously desirable, especially as the possibility of resonance has always to be considered. The development given in this paper, even if it proves to be needlessly thorough for practical tidal work, will cover the needs of research work, since it includes all terms whose coefficients (relatively to the greatest coefficient) are greater than 0·00010.},
