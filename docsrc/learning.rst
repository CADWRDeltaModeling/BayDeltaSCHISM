Tutorials
`Hello SCHISM tutorials <https://cadwrdeltamodeling.github.io/HelloSCHISM/>`_ are a set of SCHISM tutorials that introduce basic features, our preprocessors and can get you running the model quickly (Windows friendly).

The :doc:`Bay Delta SCHISM User Guide <user_guide>` explains many of the details of setting up and interpreting a full Bay-Delta simulation, making use of the full toolset. 


:doc:`Bay-Delta Tutorials <bay_delta_tutorials>` and presentations describe model assumptions and model input preparation for Bay-Delta SCHISM.

:doc:`Linux hints <linux>` help get you started and avoid some gotchas for things like copying and archiving runs

Manuals
-------

`SCHISM Manuals <http://ccrm.vims.edu/schismweb/schism_manual.html>`_ are available for SCHISM at the VIMS site. 

There is some documentation for our Python libraries online, including:

  * `schimpy <https://cadwrdeltamodeling.github.io/schimpy/>`_ and our templates/preprocessors for grids and spatial inputs.
  * `vtools3 <https://cadwrdeltamodeling.github.io/vtools3/index.html>`_ an extension to schimpy that includes some time series manipulations we need that go beyond basic `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/>`_ which is a prerequisite. 
  * `dms_datastore <https://cadwrdeltamodeling.github.io/dms_datastore/html/index.html>`_ a library for getting data associated with the Bay-Delta.
