Bay-Delta SCHISM Topical Guide
==============================

The following topic guides take you through what it takes to set up a basic model run using the Bay-Delta SCHISM toolchain. You won't have action items on all the topics for every run, but you should learn generally about the items and where the 'gotchas' are. It is also useful to familiarize yourself with these and other utilities. Or ask us -- we would much rather see an existing utility get better used and refined than have the same tool get reinvented many times.
