Training
========

The next training is scheduled for 2023. We are cp,[;etomg a training course that includes material on how to run SCHISM, the major assumptions of our Bay-Delta application, tools for applying the model in the Bay-Delta as well visualization of results and introductory material on how to extend the model. The course is interwoven with material on numerical modelling and estuary processes as necessary to understand the model inputs.


Support
=======

Please send your questions to Eli.Ateljevich@water.ca.gov. 

We'll field your questions and help you scope any SCHISM-related efforts as best we can.
Our hope is that we can help external institutions and modelers become qualified, 
self-sufficient users.
