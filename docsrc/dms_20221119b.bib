	abstract = {Initial-boundary value problems for several systems of partial differential equations from fluid dynamics are discussed. Both rigid wall and open boundary problems are treated. Boundary conditions are formulated and shown to yield well-posed problems for the Eulerian equations for gas dynamics, the shallow-water equations, and linearized constant coefficient versions of the incompressible, anelastic equations. The "primitive" hydrostatic meteorological equations are shown to be ill-posed with any specification of local, pointwise boundary conditions. Analysis of simplified versions of this system illustrates the mechanism responsible for ill-posedness.},

	abstract = {We present a new vertical coordinate system for cross-scale applications. Dubbed {LSC}2 (Localized Sigma Coordinates with Shaved Cell), the new system allows each node of the grid to have its own vertical grid, while still maintaining reasonable smoothness across horizontal and vertical dimensions. Furthermore, the staircase created by the mismatch of vertical levels at adjacent nodes is eliminated with a simple shaved-cell like approach using the concept of degenerate prisms. The new system is demonstrated to have the beneﬁts of both terrain-following and Z-coordinate systems, while minimizing their adverse effects. We implement {LSC}2 in a 3D unstructured-grid model ({SELFE}) and demonstrate its superior performance with test cases on lake and ocean stratiﬁcation.},
