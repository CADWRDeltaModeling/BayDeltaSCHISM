# bdschism

Tools for launching and evaluating Bay-Delta SCHISM runs. This package is for Bay-Delta tasks that benefit from a real deployment. These include
consolidating steps inherent to our typical workflow. 


Installation
------------

The schism_environment in BayDeltaSCHISM should be sufficient to run and evaluate SCHISM and is recommended here.

This environment is not on conda. It may be required to handle using a "developer install", which keeps the files right in your install directory:

`BayDeltaSCHISM/bdschism$ pip install --no-deps -e .`
