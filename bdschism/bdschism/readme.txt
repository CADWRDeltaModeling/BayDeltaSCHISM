Scripts for postprocessing, particularly for Bay-Delta specific projects

lsz habitat arcrage processing:

gen_lsz_zone.py: create a netcdf file with lsz flag over a specified period.

gen_lsz_zone_ts.py: create a netcdf file with lsz flag over a specified period, and output
                    lsz arcrage over the period for 5 sub regions defined by subregion.nc.
                                       
gen_zone_flags.py: You need to run this script before run gen_lsz_zone_ts.py to generate zone flag
                   nc file subregion.nc. This script will read subregion polygon points UTM_XY defined
                   in 5 txt file,cache_mzm_link_points.txt,north_arc_points.txt,suisun_bay_points.txt,
                   delta_points.txt and suisun_marsh_points.txt. It need a schism output file as input
                   to get your schism model mesh.

Bay-Delta X2 location interpolation:

x2route.csv : X2 route points UTM coordinates.

extract_x2_station_xyz.py: the tool to create salinity observation station in SCHSIM bp format. This script
                           select sation every 200m along the route defined in x2route.csv.

x2_stations.bp: the station bp file created by extract_x2_station_xyz.py. User can use this file to extract
                salinity from combined or uncombined SCHISM outputs using read_output_xyz in SCHISM utility.

process_x2_ts.py: read salinity time series generated by read_output_xyz and interpolate and output X2 location 
                  time series.
                  
port_boundary.py: script to port various flow data formats (e.g., from CalSim, csv, etc.) into SCHISM time history (.th) files.
