Bay-Delta SCHISM User Guide
===========================

The following topical guides take you through what it takes to set up a basic model run using the Bay-Delta SCHISM toolchain. You won't have action items on all the topics for every run, but the :ref:`Bay-Delta SCHISM Essentials <essentials>` section will get you started on a basic hindcast and the :ref:`Topical Guides <topical>` describe numerous common modeling tasks and where the gotchas are.
