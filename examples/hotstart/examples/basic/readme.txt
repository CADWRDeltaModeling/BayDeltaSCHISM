Basic case
Only two tracers are modeled: temperature and salinity. 
Both temperature and salinity are initialized by patch_init options, where the ocean uses a constant, san franciscity bay uses USGS polaris transect data, suisun bay uses either USGS Polaris data (when available) or obserations, and delta and suisun marsh both use 15-min continuous observational data.
