\subsection{Transport equation}
The advection-diffusion-reaction equation is the same in form for any tracer. 
SELFE uses it to track salt, temperature and sediment concentration and water quality constituents. 
The equation for a generic tracer $T$ is:
\beqa
  \frac{\pd T}{\pd t}+\nabla \cdot (\bs{u}T)
	&=& \frac{\pd }{\pd x} (\kappa_h \frac{\pd T}{\pd x}) + \frac{\pd }{\pd y} (\kappa_h \frac{\pd T}{\pd y})
	+\frac{\pd }{\pd z} (\kappa \frac{\pd T}{\pd z}) +\hat{Q},\label{tr1}\\
\eeqa
with vertical boundary conditions at the bed and free surface:
\beqa
  \kappa \frac{\pd T}{\pd z} &=& \hat{T}, \mbox{ at } z=\eta, \label{tr2} \\
  \kappa \frac{\pd T}{\pd z} &=& \hat{T_b}, \mbox{ at } z=-h, \label{tr3}
\eeqa
and concentration (Dirichlet, essential) boundary conditions at inflows and ocean boundaries.
where 
\begin{align*}
&T(x,y,z,t)  &\text{concentration of the tracer} &\\
&\bs{u}(x,y,z,t)  &\text{3D velocity (m/s)}  &\\
&\kappa_{h} &\text{horizontal diffusivity} (m^2s^{-1}) &\\
&\kappa   &\text{vertical diffusivity}(m^2s^{-1}) &\\
&\hat{Q}  & \text{mass source}  &\\
\end{align*}

and the 3D velocity $\bs{u}$ must be provided in a mass-conserving (divergence free) form:
\beq
  \nabla \cdot (\bs{u})=0 \label{tr5}
\eeq

Horizontal mixing of constituent concentration was ignored throughout our project, 
which is equivalent to $\kappa_h=0$. When shear in the main flow field is adequately
resolved, scaling arguments usually indicate that horizontal eddy diffusivity is very small
compared to the other terms and we assume that enough is introduced by the unavoidable horizontal
numerical diffusion introduced in solving the equations.
