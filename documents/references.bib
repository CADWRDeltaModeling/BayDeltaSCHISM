  abstract = {The most common method for determining vorticity from planar velocity
	information is the circulation method. Its performance has been evaluated
	using a plane of velocity data obtained from a direct numerical simulation
	(DNS) of a three dimensional plane shear layer. Both the ability
	to reproduce the vorticity from the exact velocity field and one
	perturbed by a 5% random "uncertainty" were assessed. To minimize
	the sensitivity to velocity uncertainties, a new method was developed
	using a least-squares approach. The local velocity data is fit to
	a model velocity field consisting of uniform translation, rigid rotation,
	a point source, and plane shear. The least-squares method was evaluated
	in the same manner as the circulation method. The largest differences
	between the actual and calculated vorticity fields were due to the
	filter-like nature of the methods. The new method is less sensitive
	to experimental uncertainty. However the circulation method proved
	to be slightly better at reproducing the DNS field. The least-squares
	method provides additional information beyond the circulation method
	results. Using the correlation p'o)o9 and a vorticity threshold criteria
	to identify regions of rigid rotation (or eddies), the rigid rotation
	component of the least-squares method indicates these same regions.},

  title = {{Representation of Topography by Shaved Cells in a Height Coordinate
	Ocean Model}},
  journal = {Mon. Wea. Rev.},
  year = {1977},
  volume = {125},
  pages = {2293-2315},
  abstract = {Height coordinate ocean models commonly represent topography as a
	''staircase'' of discontinuous steps that are fitted to the model
	grid. Here the ramifications of an alternative approach are studied
	in which ''shaved cells'' are used to represent irregular topography.
	The problem is formulated using the finite-volume method and care
	is taken to ensure that the discrete forms have appropriate conservation
	properties. Two representations of topography, ''partial step'' and
	''piecewise linear,'' are considered and compared with the staircase
	approach in some standard problems such as the topographic effect
	and flow over a Gaussian bump. It is shown that shaved cells are
	clearly more accurate than the conventional staircase representation.
	The use of partial steps, although not as accurate as the piecewise
	linear approach, is seen to be superior to the staircase approach.
	Moreover, partial steps can be readily implemented in existing height
	coordinate models. 1. Introduction Variations in the bottom relief
	of the atmosphere are typically a fraction of the depth of the troposphere
	and yet still influence the atmospheric circulation. Variations in
	the depth of the ocean are of order 1 and hence have a major control
	on the circulation. The accurate inclusion of topography in ocean
	models is therefore a major consideration. Topography is most commonly
	represented in height coordinate ocean models as ''staircase'' or
	''step'' topography [used since Bryan (1969)], where the steps are
	chosen to fit the model grid (see Fig. 1a). As will be demonstrated
	later, this is a very crude approach that strictly only becomes reasonable
	in the limit of very high vertical and horizontal resolution. Terrain-following
	coordinates can be used to represent topography (Fig. 1b) and clearly
	recognize the importance of the steering effect of topography on
	the ocean circulation (see Haidvogel et al. 1991; Blumberg and Mellor
	1987). However, such models suffer from problems of ''hydrostatic
	consistency,'' which can be particularly troublesome above steep
	slopes (see Haney 1991; Mellor et al. 1994). Height coordinates,
	on the other hand, recognize the overwhelming importance of gravity
	in the open ocean (the pressure surfaces are almost horizontal),
	but the crude ''staircase'' representation of topography leads to
	large errors. The intent of this paper is to offer an alternative
	representation for use in height coordinate models in which Corresponding
	author address: Dr. Alistair Adcroft, Department of Earth, Atmospheric
	and Planetary Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge,
	MA 02139. E-mail: adcroft@plume.mit.edu we ''shave'' model cells
	to fit the ocean's topography (see Fig. 1c). This is the opposite
	philosophy of the ''step topography'' method in which the topography
	is fitted to the model grid. The ''shaved cell'' approach offers,
	we believe, many of the advantages of both height and terrain-following
	coordinates. We are able to show that the ''shaved cell'' method
	is potentially far superior to the ''stepwise'' representation in
	height coordinate models and can approach the fidelity of terrain-following
	coordinates without any of the hydrostatic consistency problems of
	the latter. In order to introduce the discretization that allows
	the shaving of model cells, we first describe the ''finite volume''
	technique. For a comprehensive introduction to the finite-volume
	method, we recommend Hirsch (1990). This discretization method is
	very similar to, but not the same as, the finite-differencing technique;
	in the interior of the ocean, the finite-volume and flux-form finite-difference
	discretizations are equivalent. The advantage of the finite volume
	approach in representing topography, however, is that the model cells
	need not be regular boxes and can thus be shaped to fit to the topography.
	The paper is presented in three sections. Section 2 deals with the
	finite-volume formulation in general and applies it to the continuity
	and tracer conservation equations. In section 3 we discuss some possible
	representations of topography within the finite-volume formulation.
	We illustrate the clear advantages of ''shaved cells'' over ''step''
	topography when applied to a two-dimensional passive tracer problem.
	The incompressible Boussinesq equations are then considered in section
	4 and we present experiments of oceanographic interest (using the
	numerical model of Marshall et al.},

  journal = {Journal of Hydraulic Engineering},
  year = {1986},
  volume = {112},
  pages = {771},
  abstract = {Many environmental flow problems involve mixing and transport of substances
	in a non-uniform rotating ambient. Dispersion should be treated as
	a second order tensor in such flows since the principal direction
	of motion changes continuously. Recirculating or secondary flows
	along irregular stream banks, behind hydraulic structures, in dead
	arms of streams, or in large fleeting areas are just a few examples.
	Secondary flows in open channels have been investigated and modeled
	by various researchers (1,7,10,11). These flows have been shown to
	influence the transport of pollutants in rivers and streams (3,8,9,12).
	In some studies, dispersion has been represented by a tensor (4,5,6).
	In practice, simplifying assumptions are made to make the tensor
	symmetric and, consequently, the mixing coefficient scalar. The general
	equation governing transport of mass with dispersion treated as a
	second-order tensor in Cartesian coordinates is considered here.
	Components of the dispersion tensor are given in terms of dispersion
	along and normal to the flow, scaled by the local velocity vector.
	Simulation results are given for mass transport in two-dimensional
	rotating flows. The role of cross-variant components of the dispersion
	tensor in the transport process is also examined.},

  abstract = {An exact and very general Lagrangian-mean description of the back
	effect of oscillatory disturbances upon the mean state is given.
	The basic formalism applies to any problem whose governing equations
	are given in the usual Eulerian form, and irrespective of whether
	spatial, temporal, ensemble, or â€˜two-timingâ€™ averages are appropriate.
	The generalized Lagrangian-mean velocity cannot be defined exactly
	as the â€˜mean following a single fluid particleâ€™, but in cases
	where spatial averages are taken can easily be visualized, for instance,
	as the motion of the centre of mass of a tube of fluid particles
	which lay along the direction of averaging in a hypothetical initial
	state of no disturbance. The equations for the Lagrangian-mean flow
	are more useful than their Eulerian-mean counterparts in significant
	respects, for instance in explicitly representing the effect upon
	mean-flow evolution of wave dissipation or forcing. Applications
	to irrotational acoustic or water waves, and to astrogeophysical
	problems of waves on axisymmetric mean flows are discussed. In the
	latter context the equations embody generalizations of the Eliassen-Palm
	and Charney-Drazin theorems showing the effects on the mean flow
	of departures from steady, conservative waves, for arbitrary, finite-amplitude
	disturbances to a stratified, rotating fluid, with allowance for
	self-gravitation as well as for an external gravitational field.
	The equations show generally how the pseudomomentum (or wave â€˜momentumâ€™)
	enters problems of mean-flow evolution. They also indicate the extent
	to which the net effect of the waves on the mean flow can be described
	by a â€˜radiation stressâ€™, and provide a general framework for
	explaining the asymmetry of radiation-stress tensors along the lines
	proposed by Jones (1973).},

	It is shown that maximal two-way exchange with a net barotropic flow

	and a second or 'virtual' control lying to one side of the narrowest
	section. The two controls are connected by a subcritical region,

	special limiting example of submaximal exchange, not generally applicable
	to natural flows. The addition of a net barotropic flow yields a
	range of different flow types, including maximal exchange, one-layer

	The small-scale dunes are accounted for in the numerical model by

	parametrization is examined by simulating the flow for three different
	roughness heights. It was found that, notwithstanding the coarse
	method of representing the dune forms, the qualitative agreement

	doi:10.1029/2007WR006303 2008 reveals surprisingly good agreement.
	This good agreement is explained by the minor importance of turbulence

	turbulence might well be expected considering the complex nature
	of the geometry. Furthermore, the LES results reveal a pronounced
	recirculation zone near the convex inner bank of the flume due to
	the shallowness of the flow and strong curvature of the flume. At

  abstract = {In this paper we consider domain decomposition methods for solving
	the radial basis function interpolation equations. There are three
	interwoven threads to the paper. The first thread provides good ways
	of setting up and solving small- to medium-sized radial basis function
	interpolation problems. These may occur as subproblems in a domain
	decomposition solution of a larger interpolation problem. The usual
	formulation of such a problem can suffer from an unfortunate scale
	dependence not intrinsic in the problem itself. This scale dependence
	occurs, for instance, when fitting polyharmonic splines in even dimensions.
	We present and analyze an alternative formulation, available for
	all strictly conditionally positive definite basic functions, which
	does not suffer from this drawback, at least for the very important
	example previously mentioned. This formulation changes the problem
	into one involving a strictly positive definite symmetric system,
	which can be easily and efficiently solved by Cholesky factorization.
	The second section considers a natural domain decomposition method
	for the interpolation equations and views it as an instance of von
	Neumann's alternating projection algorithm. Here the underlying Hilbert
	space is the reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by the strictly
	conditionally positive definite basic function. We show that the
	domain decomposition method presented converges linearly under very
	weak nondegeneracy conditions on the possibly overlapping subdomains.
	The last section presents some algorithmic details and numerical
	results of a domain decomposition interpolatory code for polyharmonic
	splines in 2 and 3 dimensions. This code has solved problems with
	5 million centers and can fit splines with 10,000 centers in approximately
	7 seconds on very modest hardware.},

	at the expense of the proportion of the channel occupied by the immediate
	post-confluence flow with the consequence that near-bottom velocity
	increases by a factor of 1.3 as confluence angle is increased from
	15Â°-90Â°. The implications for sediment entrainment are reviewed

	value of the bottom friction is proportional to the square of the
	instantaneous velocity, the non-periodic component of friction, averaged
	over a tidal period, is linearly proportional to the drift velocity.
	It is assumed that the water is homogeneous and that, above a skin-friction
	layer close to the bottom, the eddy viscosity is constant with depth.
	In the steady state, the drift current due to a given wind stress
	is reduced in the presence of tidal currents. Steady-state solutions,
	involving the elevation of the surface as well as the currents, are
	given for a channel of uniform width and depth, a uniformly convergent

	for applying the Lagrangian-Eulerian finite element method to solve

	approach, the advection term is handled in the Lagrangian step so
	that the associated numerical errors can be considerably reduced.
	It is important to have an adequate particle tracking technique for
	computing advection accurately in the Lagrangian step. The particle
	tracking technique presented here is designed to trace fictitious
	particles in the real-world flow field where the flow velocity is
	either measured or computed at a limited number of locations. The
	technique, named 'in-element' particle tracking, traces fictitious
	particles on an element-by-element basis. Given a velocity field,
	a fictitious particle is traced one element by one element until
	either a boundary is encountered or the available time is completely
	consumed. For the tracking within an element, the element is divided
	into a desired number of subelements with the interpolated velocity
	computed at all nodes of the subelements. A fictitious particle,
	thus, is traced one subelement by one subelement within the element.
	The desired number of subelements can be determined based on the
	complexity of the flow field being considered. The more complicated
	the flow field is, the more subelementsare needed to achieve accurate
	particle tracking results. A single-velocity approach can be used
	to efficiently perform particle tracking in a smooth flow field,
	while an average-velocityapproach can be employed to increase the
	tracking accuracy for more complex flow fields.},

	discretization on Voronoi-centroidal meshes or cell-vertex quasi-B-grid
	discretization on triangular meshes work well and offer the multiresolution
	functionality at a price of being 2 to 4 times slower per degree

	shows that the stability of these integration algorithms are determined

	can lead to erroneous classification of critical points when the

	of the mean summer (upwelling season) offshore heat flux on the northern
	California shelf. The mean offshore heat flux is predominantly in

  abstract = {Procedures to display data from acoustic Doppler current profilers
	(ADCPs) in spatial maps have been developed for surface-water hydrology.
	The procedures were designed for rapid processing of repeated ADCP
	surveys of channel reaches and junctions. Using only ADCP data, vectors
	that define the velocity field of a channel can be displayed in perspective
	over detailed bathymetry. In addition, the backscatter intensity
	recorded with ADCP velocity data provides a sediment-transport indicator.
	The prevalence of ADCPs and their ability to measure velocity fields
	encourages the exploitation of backscatter-intensity values for sediment-transport
	studies. At present, spatial ADCP data from channel surveys have
	been interpolated to volumetric vector grids to show flow and sediment
	dynamics through time animation. These visualizations have highlighted
	some discrepancies between expected flow properties and analyses
	of ADCP data, and field experiments are suggested to identify their
	origin. Examples are given in this paper using spatial ADCP data
	collected in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, California, during
	2001 and 2002. INTRODUCTION The water-quality data files of the U.S.
	Geological Survey (USGS) contain instantaneous sediment concentrations
	measured by sampling water at multiple points across streams. Hydrologists
	recognize that concentrations represent brief samples of a constituent
	that fluctuates with turbulence and changing discharge. To compensate
	for this uncertainty, we use statistical adjustments and smoothing
	techniques to approximate an average concentration for a given period.
	Standard analyses can produce crude sediment-discharge totals from
	these values, but water sampling does not resolve fluctuations in
	sediment transport that are exhibited at macroturbulent scales (tens
	of seconds, usually). Sediment suspension also varies spatially in
	relation to local sediment sources and hydrodynamics. Turbulent fluctuations
	and spatial variations both increase the uncertainty in sediment-transport
	quantities, and a record of the fluctuations and their location will

	of the signals returned from multiple depths beneath the device.

	which is the intensity of acoustic backscatter from solid particles
	suspended in the flow. By recording ADCP data when crossing a stream,
	we acquire sediment-transport indicators over the flow depth every
	1 to 4 seconds, with a lateral spacing of a few meters. If the cross-stream
	distribution of backscatter intensity is graphed, sediment suspension

  abstract = {The transports of solutes and other tracers are fundamental to estuarine
	processes. The apparent transport mechanisms are convection by tidal
	current and current-induced shear effect dispersion for processes
	which take place in a time period of the order of a tidal cycle.
	However, as emphasis is shifted toward the effects of intertidal
	processes, the net transport is mainly determined by tide-induced
	residual circulation and by residual circulation due to other processes.
	The commonly used intertidal conservation equation takes the form
	of a convection-dispersion equation in which the convective velocity
	is the Eulerian residual current, and the dispersion terms are often
	referred to as the phase effect dispersion or, sometimes, as the
	â€œtidal dispersion.â€� The presence of these dispersion terms is
	merely the result of a Fickian type hypothesis. Since the actual
	processes are not Fickian, thus a Fickian hypothesis obscures the
	physical significance of this equation. Recent research results on
	residual circulation have suggested that long-term transport phenomena
	are closely related to the Lagrangian residual current or the Lagrangian
	residual transport. In this paper a new formulation of an intertidal
	conservation equation is presented and examined in detail. In a weakly
	nonlinear tidal estuary the resultant intertidal transport equation
	also takes the form of a convection-dispersion equation without the
	ad hoc introduction of phase effect dispersion in a form of dispersion
	tensor. The convective velocity in the resultant equation is the
	first-order Lagrangian residual current (the sum of the Eulerian
	residual current and the Stokes drift). The remaining dispersion
	terms are important only in higher-order solutions; they are due
	to shear effect dispersion and turbulent mixing. There exists a dispersion
	boundary layer adjacent to shoreline boundaries. An order of magnitude
	estimate of the properties in the dispersion boundary layer is given.
	The present treatment of intertidal transport processes is illustrated
	by an analytical solution for an amphidromic system and by a numerical
	application in South San Francisco Bay, California. The present formulation
	reveals that the mechanism for long-term transport of solutes is
	mainly convection due to the Lagrangian residual current in the interior
	of a tidal estuary. This result also points out the weakness in the
	tidal dispersion formulation, and explains the large variability
	of the observed values for tidal dispersion coefficients. Further
	research on properties of the dispersion boundary layer is needed.},

  abstract = {Residual flow and exchange along a channel connecting an embayment
	with the coastal ocean are examined experimentally, using direct
	observations of currents and scalar concentrations across the mouth
	of San Francisco Bay. The study encompasses separate experiments
	during each of three 'seasons': winter/spring runoff (March 2002),
	summer upwelling (July 2003), and fall relaxation (October 2002).
	Within each experiment, transects across the channel were repeated
	approximately every 12 minutes for 25 hours during both spring and
	neap tides. Velocity was measured from a boat-mounted acoustic Doppler
	current profiler. Scalar concentrations were measured at the surface
	and from a tow-yoed SeaSciences Inc. Acrobat. Several sources of
	residual circulation were isolated: baroclinic flow, tidal pumping,
	and frictional phasing. We further isolated a portion of tidal pumping
	as tidal trapping of a headland eddy during flood tide. Density-driven
	flow is complicated by a dramatic growth in the cross-channel density
	gradient during the second half of ebb tide, which drives along-channel
	shear at the beginning flood tide, creating an asymmetry in frictional
	phasing. Velocity fields formed by residual circulation mechanisms
	combine with scalar concentration fields to define scalar exchange
	processes. Net salinity exchange rates for each season are quantified
	with harmonic analysis. Harmonic results are then decomposed into
	flux mechanisms using temporal and spatial correlations. In tins
	study, the temporal correlation of cross-sectionally averaged salinity
	and velocity (tidal pumping flux) is the largest component of the
	dispersive flux of salinity into the bay. From the tidal pumping
	flux portion of the dispersive flux, it is shown that there is less
	exchange than was found in earlier studies. Furthermore, tidal pumping
	flux scales strongly with freshwater flow because of density-driven
	movement of a tidally trapped eddy and stratification-induced increases
	in ebb-flood frictional phasing. Complex bathymetry leads to salinity
	exchange that scales differently with flow than would be expected
	from simple tidal asymmetry and gravitational circulation models.},

	thereby removing stability limitations associated with the surface
	gravity wave and vertical diffusion terms. The remaining terms in
	the momentum equations are discretized explicitly with the second-order
	Adams-Bashforth method, while the pressure-correction method is employed
	for the nonhydrostatic pressure in order to achieve overall second-order
	temporal accuracy. Advection of momentum is accomplished with an
	Eulerian discretization which conserves momentum in cells that do
	not contain the free surface, and scalar advection is discretized
	in a way that ensures consistency with continuity, thereby ensuring
	local and global mass conservation using a velocity field that conserves
	volume on a local and global basis. The nonhydrostatic pressure field
	is solved efficiently using a block-Jacobi preconditioner, and while
	stability is limited by the internal gravity wave speed and vertical
	advection of momentum, applications requiring relatively small time
	steps due to accuracy or stability constraints are run efficiently
	on parallel computers, since the present formulation is written entirely
	with the message-passing interface (MPI). The ParMETIS libraries
	are employed in order to achieve a load-balanced parallel partitioning
	that minimizes interprocessor communication, and the grid is reordered
	to optimize per-processor performance by limiting cache misses while
	accessing arrays in memory. Test cases demonstrate the ability of
	the code to efficiently and accurately compute the nonhydrostatic
	lock exchange and internal waves in idealized as well as real domains,
	and we evaluate the parallel efficiency of the code using up to 32
	processors. {\'O} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  volume = {16},
  pages = {113 - 125},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {A simple numerical model demonstrates that the reduction in turbulence
	due to stratification greatly enhances the trapping of suspended
	sediment that occurs at the estuarine turbidity maximum. In moderately
	and highly stratified estuaries the turbulent diffusivity decreases
	markedly between the region upstream of the salinity intrusion, where
	the turbulence is uninhibited by salt stratification, and the stratified
	regime within the salinity intrusion, where turbulence is reduced
	by the inhibitory influence of salt stratification. This reduction
	in turbulent diffusion results in a reduction in the quantity of
	sediment that can be carried by the flow, causing sediment to be
	trapped near the landward limit of the salinity intrusion. This trapping
	process occurs at the same location as that due to the estuarine
	convergence, but it appears to be many times more effective at trapping
	silt-size particles. A model is formulated that is similar to Festa
	and Hansen' (1978) model of the estuarine turbidity maximum, with
	s the addition of a stratification-dependent eddy diffusivity. For
	silt-size sediment particles, the model indicates as much as a to-fold
	increase in the trapping rate with inclusion of the stratification
	effect. It is likely that this mechanism is important in many partially
	mixed and highly stratified estuaries. Introduction The turbidity
	maximum is a region of locallyelevated suspended matter concentration
	that occurs near the landward limit of salt intrusion in estuaries
	(e.g., Glangeaud 1938; Postma 1967; Schubel 1968). Postma (1967)
	proposed that the turbidity maximum is maintained by the convergence
	in near-bottom flow associated with the estuarine circulation. He
	hypothesized that the strength of the turbidity maximum should depend
	on the amount of sediment originating from riverine or oceanic sources,
	the strength of the estuarine circulation, and the fall velocity
	of the sediment. Festa and Hansen (1978) verified Postma' s hypothesis
	with a numerical simulation, which showed that the estuarine circulation
	results in elevated sediment concentrations at the landward limit
	of the salinity intrusion for finite fall velocities. Festa and Hansen'
	model was a significant s step toward quantifying the mechanics of
	the turbidity maximum. However, the model did not account for variations
	in vertical diffusivity, K, between the unstratified and stratified
	portions of the domain, which will be shown in this paper to be a
	major factor contributing to the turbidity maximum. Other studies
	have noted the important influence of tidal motions on the estuarine
	turbidity maximum. Many observational studies (Schubel 1968; Wellershaus

	algorithmic complexity, matured in the literature on information

	community. In the pages that follow, we review both the practical
	as well as the theoretical aspects of MDL as a tool for model selection,

	At the boundary between these two disciplines, we nd many interesting
	interpretations of popular frequentist and Bayesian procedures. As

	b s t r a c t This paper presents a high-resolution numerical method
	for solving mass transport problems involving advection and anisotropic
	diffusion in shallow water based on unstructured mesh. An alternating
	operator-splitting technique is adopted to advance the numerical
	solution with advection and diffusion terms solved separately in
	two steps. By introducing a new r-factor into the Total Variation
	Diminishing (TVD) limiter, an improved finite-volume method is developed
	to solve the advection term with significant reduction of numerical
	diffusion and oscillation errors. In addition, a coordinate transformation
	is introduced to simplify the diffusion term with the Green-Gauss
	theorem used to deal with the anisotropic effect based on unstructured
	mesh. The new scheme is validated against three benchmark cases with
	separated and combined advection and diffusion transport processes
	involved. Results show that the scheme performs better than existing
	methods in predicting the advective transport, particularly when
	a sharp concentration front is in presence. The model also provides
	a sound solution for the anisotropic diffusion phenomenon. Anisotropic
	diffusion has been largely neglected by existing flow models based
	on unstructured mesh, which usually treat the diffusion process as
	being isotropic for simplicity. Based on the flow field provided
	by the ELCIRC model, the developed transport model was successfully
	applied to simulate the transport of a hypothetical conservative
	tracer in a bay under the influence of tides.},

	Secondary currents were strong at times (varying by up to 35 cm/s

	short travel time around the bend did not allow a steady state balance

	the flood tide the confluence of two streams with different velocities
	produced a strong lateral gradient in streamwise velocity. As a result,
	lateral advection was a significant term in the streamwise momentum
	balance, having the same order of magnitude as the barotropic and
	baroclinic pressure gradients, and the frictional terms. During the
	first part of the ebb, secondary currents were induced by lateral
	baroclinic forcing. The direction of the secondary circulation reversed
	later in the ebb, as the baroclinic forcing became weaker than the
	centrifugal acceleration. The gradient Richardson number showed that

	concentration were measured in transects across Suisun Cutoff, in

	cycle. During flood tides an axial density front developed between
	fresher water flowing from the shallows of Grizzly Bay into the northern

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the representation of secondary circulation
	in river channel confluences. Recent research has emphasized the
	complex three-dimensional flow fields that exist where two river
	channels join. Field and laboratory measurements have been developed
	to describe time-averaged flow fields in terms of primary and secondary
	circulation, and to interpret these in terms of key generating processes.
	Central to this research is the need to understand the effect that
	flow structures have upon both mixing processes and confluence geomorphology,
	notably the development of scour-holes within the junction zone.
	One of the common problems faced by this research is the dependence
	of observed secondary flow structures upon the rotation plane for
	which they are determined. Different researchers have used different
	rotation planes, such that intercomparison of results from different
	field sites is difficult. Problems also arise when only two-dimensional
	measurements (e.g. downstream and cross-stream) are available, and
	vertical velocities need to be inferred from analysis of secondary
	circulation patterns. If different analytical methods produce different
	patterns, so different inferences could be reached. This paper uses
	a numerical model to show: (i) that different analytical methods
	do result in very different estimates of the strength of secondary
	circulation; (ii) that there are problems in inferring vertical velocities
	from secondary circulation cells identified using these methods in
	confluences, most notably as a result of the effects of planform
	acceleration and deceleration; and (iii) that field and laboratory
	measurements suffer from being unable to measure the three-dimensional
	flow field instantaneously, and hence allow understanding of the
	evolution of flow structures through time. A three-dimensional solution
	of the Navierâ€“Stokes equations for open channel flow, combined

  abstract = {A phase-matching method is introduced to calculate the bottom drag
	coefficient in tidal channels with significant lateral variation
	of depth. The method is based on the fact that the bottom friction
	in a tidal channel causes tidal velocity to have a phase difference
	across the channel. The calculation involves a few steps. First,
	the observed horizontal velocity components are analyzed to obtain
	the amplitude and phase of the velocity at the major tidal frequency.
	The phase of the longitudinal velocity is then fitted to a relationship
	derived from the linearized momentum balance. The drag coefficient
	is then calculated. This method is applicable to narrow (approximately
	a few kilometers wide) tidal channels without strong stratification
	and where the cross-channel variation of surface elevation is negligible
	compared to tidal amplitude. This analytic approach is easy to implement
	when appropriate observational data are available. It allows a spatial
	variation of the drag coefficient, and the resolution is only limited
	by that of the observations. The method is validated by identical
	twin experiments and applied to tidal velocity data, obtained in
	the James River Estuary, using an acoustic Doppler current profiler
	during spring tides and neap tides in October-November 1996. The
	obtained bottom drag coefficient ranged from 1.2 {\^A} 10{\`A}3 to
	6.9 {\^A} 10{\`A}3 at different positions along two cross-channel
	transects each 4 km long and 2 to 14 m deep. The maximum drag coefficient
	is found in the shallowest water near the banks of the estuary, while
	the minimum values occur between 9 and 12 m in the center of the
	channel. The friction of the lateral boundary may have contributed
	to the apparent increase of the bottom friction on the banks. The

  abstract = {In order to calculate the mean mass flux past a given recording station
	it is necessary to know more than the mean velocity in a fixed, vertical
	section. One must add an additional term--the ' Stokes velocity '
	which depends also oil the time and distance scales of the fluctuating
	currents. In typical circumstances, where the fluctuations are larger
	than the mean current, the Stokes velocity may dominate the mass
	transport, and lead to the mass transport being opposite in direction
	to the mean current. Some general expressions are given for the Stokes
	velocity, and these are studied in detail for the particular case
	of waves propagated along a sloping sea bed (double Kelvin waves).
	Such waves are always propagated with the shallower water to their
	right in the northern hemisphere. It is shown that in regions of
	small bottom gradient the Stokes velocity is in the same direction
	as the phase velocity, but in the region of large bottom gradient
	the sign of the Stokes velocity is reversed. The mean Stokes velocity
	is in the direction of wave propagation. However, the total transport

	time scales ranging from seconds to decades, they have historically
	been studied at the lower (weekly to interannual) frequencies. The
	aim of this study was to investigate intradaily variability of three
	water quality parameters in a small freshwater tidal lagoon (Mildred
	Island, California). High frequency time series of specific conductivity,
	water temperature, and chlorophyll a at two locations within the
	habitat were analyzed in conjunction with supporting hydrodynamic,
	meteorological, biological, and spatial mapping data. All three constituents
	exhibited large amplitude intradaily (e.g., semidiurnal tidal and
	diurnal) oscillations, and periodicity varied across constituents,
	space, and time. Like other tidal embayments, this habitat is influenced
	by several processes with distinct periodicities including physical
	controls, such as tides, solar radiation, and wind, and biological
	controls, such as photosynthesis, growth, and grazing. A scaling
	approach was developed to estimate individual process contributions
	to the observed variability. Scaling results were generally consistent
	with observations and together with detailed examination of time
	series and time derivatives, revealed specific mechanisms underlying
	the observed periodicities, including interactions between the tidal
	variability, heating, wind, and biology. The implications for monitoring
	were illustrated through subsampling of the data set. This exercise
	demonstrated how quantities needed by scientists and managers (e.g.,
	mean or extreme concentrations) may be misrepresented by low frequency
	data and how short-duration high frequency measurements can aid in
	the design and interpretation of temporally coarser sampling programs.
	The dispersive export of chlorophyll a from the habitat exhibited
	a fortnightly variability corresponding to the modulation of semidiurnal
	tidal currents with the diurnal cycle of phytoplankton variability,
	demonstrating how high frequency interactions can govern long-term
	trends. Process identification, as through the scaling analysis here,
	can help us anticipate changes in system behavior and adapt our own

	equation governing the section-averaged salinity. A technique for
	specifying the ocean boundary condition is given, and solutions are

	diffusion it is possible to reproduce the few existing analytical
	solutions, in particular the Hansen and Rattray (1965) Central Regime

  abstract = {The adjustment of estuarine circulation and density to changes in
	river flow and tidal mixing is investigated using analytical and
	numerical models. Tidally averaged momentum and salinity equations
	in a rectangular estuary are vertically averaged over two levels,
	resulting in equations that are analytically tractable while retaining
	a broad range of time-dependent behavior. It is found that both strongly
	stratified and well-mixed estuaries respond rapidly to either type
	of forcing change, while those of intermediate stratification respond
	more slowly. Intermediate estuaries also have the greatest sensitivity
	to change. Exchange flow dominates the up-estuary salt flux in strongly
	stratified cases. Changing the river flow in such cases leads to
	an internal wave propagating the length of the estuary, which accomplishes
	much of the adjustment. The internal wave speed thus controls the
	adjustment time. Increased tidal mixing in strongly stratified cases
	initially decreases the exchange flow contribution to up-estuary
	salt flux by decreasing both the stratification and the vertical
	current shear. However, the decreased up-estuary salt flux leads
	to a loss of total salt in the estuary, and hence a greater longitudinal
	salinity gradient. The increasing gradient eventually restores the
	exchange-flow salt flux to near its original value. Well-mixed solutions
	have an advectiveâ€“diffusive balance between river flow and longitudinal
	tidal mixing. In these cases the adjustment time corresponds to the
	time it takes the depth-averaged flow to travel the length scale
	of the salt intrusion, a result that applies to both types of changes
	considered. In all cases the adjustment depends upon the dynamical
	feedback between the longitudinal salt flux and the longitudinal
	salinity gradient, which varies as the estuary gains or loses total
	salt.},

	of advection-dominated problems in computational Â¯uid dynamics are
	often relaxed by employing EulerianÂ±Lagrangian methods. These are
	also known as semi-Lagrangian methods in the atmospheric sciences.
	Such methods involve backward time integration of a characteristic
	equation to find the departure point of a Â¯uid particle arriving
	at a Eulerian grid point. The value of the advected field at the
	departure point is obtained by interpolation. Both the trajectory
	integration and repeated interpolation inÂ¯uence accuracy. We compare
	the accuracy and performance of interpolation schemes based on piecewise
	cubic polynomials and cubic B-splines in the context of a distributed
	memory, parallel computing environment. The computational cost and
	interprocessor communication requirements for both methods are reported.
	Spline interpolation has better conservation properties but requires
	the solution of a global linear system, initially appearing to hinder
	a distributed memory implementation. The proposed parallel algorithm
	for multidimensional spline interpolation has almost the same communication
	overhead as local piecewise polynomial interpolation. We also compare
	various techniques for tracking trajectories given different values
	for the Courant number. Large Courant numbers require a high-order

	we investigate a new model, called SURF WB, especially designed for
	the simulation of wave transformations over strongly varying topography.
	This model relies on a recent reconstruction method for the treatment
	of the bed-slope source term and is able to handle strong variations
	of topography and to preserve the steady states at rest. In addition,
	the use of the recent VFRoe-ncv Riemann solver leads to a robust

  abstract = {Numerical modeling of flow dynamics in river channels may require
	the spatial interpolation of scattered measurements of bathymetry
	elevation to obtain elevations at computational mesh nodes. This
	paper examines the various spatial interpolation methods used in
	interpolating river channel bathymetry. Commonly used interpolation
	methods, namely inverse distance weighting, spline (tension and regularized),
	natural neighbor, TopoGrid, and ordinary kriging (isotropic and anisotropic)
	are evaluated within the ArcGIS environment by using root mean square
	error (RMSE) criteria. To study the anisotropic effects, the interpolation
	methods are evaluated in two different coordinate systems: a Cartesian
	(x, y) coordinate system and a flow-oriented (s, n) coordinate system.
	Using the data from the Brazos River in Texas, it is shown that TopoGrid,
	natural neighbor and ordinary kriging, which do not account of anisotropy
	in the data, performed better than anisotropic kriging in the Cartesian
	coordinate system. In the flow-oriented coordinate system, the performance
	of anisotropic spatial interpolation methods is significantly better
	(40% reduction in RMSE) compared to the isotropic interpolation methods.
	A modified version of inverse distance weighting method, called elliptical
	inverse distance weighting (EIDW), is developed to account for river
	anisotropy. The RMSE results from application of EIDW are close to
	that from anisotropic kriging, thus providing a simple and computationally

	and how it is affected by freshwater flow are discussed. Two datasets
	are examined: the first is 23 years of daily salinity data taken
	by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation along the axis of northern San
	Francisco Bay; the second is a set of salinity transects taken by
	the U.S. Geological Survey between 1988 and 1993. Central to this
	paper is a measure of salinity intrusion, X2: the distance from the
	Golden Gate Bridge to where the bottom salinity is 2 psu. Using X2
	to scale distance, the authors find that for most flow conditions,
	the mean salinity distribution of the estuary is nearly self-similar
	with a salinity gradient in the center 70% of the region between
	the Golden Gate and X2 that is proportional to X-12. Analysis of
	covariability of Q and X2 showed a characteristic timescale of adjustment
	of the salinity field of approximately 2 weeks. The steady-state
	response deduced from the X2 time series implies that X2 is proportional
	to riverflow to the 1/7 power. This relation, which differs from
	the standard 1/3 power dependence that is derived theoretically assuming
	constant exchange coefficients, shows that the upstream salt flux
	associated with gravitational circulation is more sensitive to the
	longitudinal salinity gradient than theory supposes. This is attributed
	to the strengthening of stratification caused by the stronger longitudinal
	salinity gradient that accompanies larger river flows.},

	turbulence produced by mean shear at the top of the canopy is important.
	The lower canopy is called the â€œlongitudinal exchange zoneâ€� because
	it communicates with surrounding water predominantly through longitudinal
	advection. In this region turbulence is generated locally by the
	canopy elements, and the momentum budget is a simple balance of vegetative
	drag and pressure gradient. In emergent canopies, only a longitudinal
	exchange zone is present. When the canopy becomes submerged, a vertical
	exchange zone appears at the top of the canopy and deepens into the

  abstract = {In February 1991, an array of six current-meter moorings was deployed
	for one year across the central California outer shelf and slope.
	The main line of the array extended 30 km o!shore of the shelf break,
	out to water depths of 1400 m. A more sparsely-instrumented line,
	displaced 30 km to the northwest, extended 14 km o!shore. Though
	shorter, the northern line spanned similar water depths because the
	gradient of the topography steepened in the northern region. A poleward
	#ow pattern, typical of the California undercurrent, was seen across
	both lines in the array over most of the year. The poleward #ow was
	surface intensi"ed. In general, the portion of the undercurrent that
	crossed the southern line had larger amplitudes and penetrated more
	deeply into the water column than the portion that crossed the northern
	line. Transport over the year ranged from 0 to 2.5 Sverdrups (Sv)
	poleward across the southern line; 0 to 1 Sv poleward across the
	northern line. We suggest the di!erence in transport was caused by
	topographic constraints, which tended to force the poleward #ow o!shore
	of the northern measurement sites. The slope of the topography steepened
	too abruptly to allow the poleward #ow to follow isobaths when currents
	were strong. When current velocities lessened, a more coherent #ow
	pattern was seen across both lines in the array. In general, the
	poleward #ow patterns in the undercurrent were not a!ected by local
	winds or by the local alongshore pressure gradient. Nor was a strong
	seasonal pattern evident. Rather unexpectedly, a small but statistically
	signi"cant fraction of the current variance over the mid- and outer
	slope was driven by the surface wind stress. An alongshelf wind stress
	caused currents to #ow along the slope, parallel to the wind "eld,
	down to depths of 400 m below the surface and out to distances of
	2 Rossby radii past the shelf break. The transfer functions were

  pages = {147 - 171},
  abstract = {In intertidal regions with subtidal channels, effects of bathymetry
	on overlying flow vary greatly with tidal stage. Around low water
	when mudflats and marsh are exposed, flow is constrained to channels,
	but when water depths are greater, tidal forcing may not necessarily
	be aligned with meandering channel axes. Flow across the channel
	can generate strong shear and turbulence at the elevation of the
	channel banks and can significantly increase turbulent energy in
	the middle of the water column. Field observations in a mudflat channel
	of San Francisco Bay indicate that cross-channel shear regularly
	occurs there early in ebb tides. With increased freshwater flow,
	baroclinic forcing can enhance shear by decoupling flow between dense
	water flooding in the channel and fresher water ebbing above the
	channel banks. A water column numerical model with k-$\varepsilon$
	turbulence closure is modified to represent the cross-channel shear
	production. Numerical results with uniform density indicate that
	turbulence production increases with the angle between the barotropic
	tidal forcing and the channel axis. When a longitudinal salinity
	gradient is imposed, cross-channel shear production contributes to
	breakdown of periodic stratification. Turbulence produced at the
	channel banks locally exceeds dissipation, and the excess energy
	is either lost to buoyancy or diffuses vertically to lower energy
	regions near the surface and near the bed. The balance among shear
	production, buoyancy production, and diffusion of turbulence depends
	on the flow angle and the strength of the longitudinal salinity gradient.},

  abstract = {Field observations indicate that a tidal salinity front that is regenerated
	each lower low water is a prominent feature of intertidal zone flow
	during wet winter months. A strong longitudinal density gradient
	at the front influences flow dynamics through tidal straining and
	baroclinic forcing. During each inundation period the salinity gradient
	disperses as it advects across the intertidal zone. The average longitudinal
	dispersivity estimated from observations is about 10 m2 s{\`A}1.
	A three-dimensional numerical model yields comparable estimates of
	tidally averaged dispersivity for an idealized bathymetry with a
	subtidal channel and intertidal shoals. The instantaneous dispersivity
	through the tidal cycle depends on both vertical and lateral shear
	in along-channel velocity. Dispersion due to vertical shear is greatest
	during stratified ebbs and inversely depends on tidal forcing; dispersion
	due to lateral shear results from bathymetric variability between
	channel and shoal and increases with tidal amplitude. Similarly,
	the along-channel residual velocity is a combination of baroclinic
	and frictional processes. Frictional effects dominate the depth-averaged
	residual such that net flow is upstream on the shoals and downstream
	in the channel; however, the frictional pattern is moderated by baroclinic
	forcing at the front. Although along-channel dynamics dominate, differential
	advection of the salinity front establishes lateral baroclinic circulation
	between channel and shoals. Lateral residual circulation is flood
	dominant with dense water moving out of channel near the bed and
	convergence from the shoals at the surface. At times near the front
	the lateral salt flux can significantly affect the salinity budget

  abstract = {Previous process-oriented field studies of stream confluences have
	focused mainly on fluvial dynamics at or immediately downstream of
	the location where the confluent flows enter the downstream channel.
	This study examines in detail the spatial evolution of the time-averaged
	downstream velocity, cross-stream velocity, and temperature fields
	between the junction apex, where the flows initially meet, and the
	entrance to the downstream channel. A well-defined, vertically oriented
	mixing interface exists within this portion of the confluence, suggesting
	that lateral mixing of the incoming flows is limited. The downstream
	velocity field near the junction apex is characterized by two high-velocity
	cores separated by an intervening region of low-velocity or recirculating
	fluid. In the downstream direction, the high-velocity cores move
	inwards towards the mixing interface and high-velocity fluid progressively
	extends downwards into a zone of scour, resulting in an increase
	in flow velocity in the centre of the confluence. The cross-stream
	velocity field is dominated by flow convergence, but also includes
	a component associated with a consistent pattern of secondary circulation.
	This pattern is characterized by two surface-convergent helical cells,
	one on each side of the mixing interface. The helical cells appear
	to be the mechanism by which high-momentum fluid near the surface
	is advected downwards into the zone of scour. For transport-ineffective
	flows, the dimensions and intensities of the cells are controlled
	by the momentum ratio of the confluent streams and by the extant
	bed morphology within the confluence. Although the flow structure
	of formative events was not measured directly in this study, documented
	patterns of erosion and deposition within the central region of the
	confluence suggest that these events are dynamically similar to the
	measured flows, except for the fact that formative flows are not
	constrained by, but can reshape, the bed morphology. The results
	of this investigation are consistent with and augment previous findings
	on time-averaged flow structure in the downstream portion of the

  abstract = {Measurements of downstream and cross-stream velocities at a small,
	asymmetrical stream confluence show that the structure of low-stage
	flows is influenced by the tributary/main stem momentum flux ratio,
	the total discharge of the incoming flows, and the bed morphology.
	Flow accelerates through the confluence during all three measured
	events. This acceleration is associated with a downstream reduction
	in channel capacity caused in part by the presence of a large bar
	along the inner bank of the downstream channel. As the momentum ratio
	increases, flow from the lateral tributary increasingly deflects
	flow from the main stream toward the outer channel bank within the
	confluence. As a result, the mixing interface between the converging
	flows also shifts outward. The large bar in the downstream channel
	deflects flow along the inner bank toward the adjacent scour hole,
	enhancing flow convergence downstream of the confluence and producing
	a region of flow separation adjacent to, or in the lee of the bar.
	The loci of maximum topographic deflection and flow separation vary
	with momentum ratio and total discharge. Secondary circulation within
	the downstream channel is characterized by a single large helical
	cell when the momentum ratio exceeds one, and weak surface-convergent
	helical cells on opposite sides of the mixing interface when the
	momentum ratio is less than one. Curvature of the flow, and thus
	the strength of helical motion, is greatest on the tributary side
	of the mixing interface. Although the flow events measured in this
	study did not exceed the threshold for sediment movement, the bed
	morphology at the confluence can be explained by the flow structure
	observed during these low-stage events, suggesting that formative
	flows may have similar downstream and cross-stream velocity fields.},

	moored on the seabed has been used to observe the mean and turbulent

	cycles at neap and spring tides. The Reynolds stress has been estimated
	from the difference in variance between the along-beam velocities
	of opposing acoustic beams with a correction for the sampling scheme
	and bin size. Shear stress was found to vary regularly with the predominantly
	semidiurnal tidal flow with the stresses on the spring ebb flow (up
	to 4.5 Pa) being generally greater than on the flood flow ( 2 Pa)
	when the currents are weaker. The vertical structure approximated
	to linear stress profiles decreasing from maximum values near the
	bed to almost zero stresses just below the surface. The variation
	in the bed stress was well represented by a quadratic drag law, based
	on the depth-mean current, with an estimated drag coefficient of
	2.6 0.2 10 3 . The production of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) followed
	a regular cycle at the M 4 frequency with maximum values exceeding
	1 W m 3 near the bed during ebb flow at spring tides and decreasing
	with height to 10 3 W m 3 at 2 m below the surface. Production was
	generally lowest ( 10 4 W m 3 ) at low water slack, which was longer
	than high water slack, and is marked by a rapid transition from flood
	to ebb. During peak ebb and flood the vertical distribution of production
	and the eddy viscosity N z are reasonably well described by a proposed
	model based on the law of the wall and a steady balance between the
	pressure gradient and a uniform shear stress gradient. The stress
	values have been incorporated into a trial dynamical balance based
	on the vertically integrated linearized equation of motion along
	the channel. The pressure gradient term is determined by two tide
	gauges separated by 5 km in the along-channel direction. The stress
	variation is in the correct phase to match the combined slope and
	acceleration term but is only about 60% of the magnitude required
	for balance. It is suggested that this discrepancy may result from
	an overestimation of the local pressure gradient, which may vary
	significantly between the tide gauges due to changes in the channel

	the important impact that tidal and lateral asymmetries in turbulent
	mixing have on the tidally averaged residual circulation. A reduction
	in turbulent mixing during the ebb phase of the tide caused by tidal
	straining of the axial density gradient results in increased vertical
	velocity shear throughout the water column during the ebb tide. In
	the absence of significant lateral differences in turbulent mixing,
	the enhanced ebb-directed transport caused by tidal straining is
	balanced by a reduction in the net seaward-directed barotropic pressure
	gradient, resulting in laterally uniform two-layer residual flow.
	However, the channel-shoal morphology of many drowned river valley
	estuaries often leads to lateral gradients in turbulent mixing. Tidal
	straining may then lead to tidal asymmetries in turbulent mixing
	near the deeper channel while the neighboring shoals remain relatively
	well mixed. As a result, the largest lateral asymmetries in turbulent
	mixing occur at the end of the ebb tide when the channel is significantly
	more stratified than the shoals. The reduced friction at the end
	of ebb delays the onset of the flood tide, increasing the duration
	of ebb in the channel. Conversely, over the shoal regions where stratification
	is more inhibited by tidal mixing, there is greater friction and
	the transition from ebb to flood occurs more rapidly. The resulting
	residual circulation is seaward over the channel and landward over
	the shoal. The shoal-channel segregation of this barotropically induced
	estuarine residual flow is opposite to that typically associated
	with baroclinic estuarine circulation over channel-shoal bathymetry.},

	mathematical feedback between the baroclinic momentum and tracer
	equations and, similarly, between the barotropic momentum and continuity
	equations, it is advantageous to treat both modes so that, after
	a time step for the momentum equation, the computed velocities participate
	immediately in the computation of tracers and continuity, and vice
	versa, rather than advancing all equations for one time step simultaneously.
	This leads to a new family of time-stepping algorithms that combine
	forward-backward feedback with the best known synchronous algorithms,
	allowing an increased time step due to the enhanced internal stability
	without sacrificing its accuracy. Based on these algorithms we design
	a split-explicit hydrodynamic kernel for a realistic oceanic model,

	This kernel utilizes consistent temporal averaging of the barotropic
	mode via a specially designed filter function to guarantee both exact
	conservation and constancy preservation properties for tracers and
	yields more accurate (up to second-order), resolved barotropic processes,

  abstract = {Buoyancy input as fresh water exerts a stratifying influence in estuaries
	and adjacent coastal waters. Predicting the development and breakdown
	of such stratification is an inherently more difficult problem than
	that involved in the analogous case of stratification induced by
	surface heating because the buoyancy input originates at the lateral
	boundaries. In the approach adopted here, we have adapted the energy
	considerations used in the surface heating problem to describe the
	competition between the stabilizing effect of fresh water and the
	vertical mixing brought about by tidal and wind stirring. Freshwater
	input induces horizontal gradients which drive the estuarine circulation
	in which lighter fluid at the surface is moved seaward over heavier
	fluid moving landward below. This contribution to stratification
	is expected to vary in time as the level of turbulence varies over
	the tidal cycle. The density gradient also interacts directly with
	the vertical shear in the tidal current to induce a periodic input
	to stratification which is positive on the ebb phase of the tide.
	Comparison of this input with the available stirring energy leads
	to a simple criterion for the existence of strain-induced stratification.
	Observations in a region of Liverpool Bay satisfying this criterion
	confirm the occurrence of a strong semidiurnal variation in stratification
	with complete vertical mixing apparent around high water except at
	neap tides when more permanent stratification may develop. A simulation
	of the monthly cycle based on a model including straining, stirring,
	and the estuarine circulation is in qualitative agreement with the
	main features of the observations.},

	and the results of the analysis are compared to theory. This comparison

	asymmetry in the flow is explained by consideration of the straininduced
	buoyancy flux, which is stabilizing on ebb tides and destabilizing
	on flood tides. Based on these observations, a scaling approach to
	estimating estuarine bottom boundary layer parameters (height and

	The analysis focuses on testing 1) a simplified turbulent kinetic

	bottom stress and near-bottom velocity gradient; and 3) a simplified

	law of the wall within approximately 1 m of the seafloor during flooding
	tides, but it departs from the law of the wall at greater heights
	during flooding tides and at all resolved heights during ebbing tides.
	The local stratification is too small to explain this effect, and

	of turbulence for decades. Analyses of these measurements have focused
	on a number of questions including estimation of integral scales
	(Bowden and Fairburn 1952, 1956; Bowden 1962), the relationship between
	turbulent shear stress and turbulence intensity (Gordon and Dohne

	1979; Gross and Nowell 1985), the use of indirect inertial-range

	The essential characteristics of a number of models are compared.
	It is further demonstrated that the mathematical stability and realisability
	of the models is crucial for practical applications. The parameter
	constraints to insure stable computations are discussed. Model performance
	is evaluated for a number of idealised entrainment scenarios that
	are typical for shelf seas: entrainment in linearly stratified and
	twolayer fluids caused by (a) surface wind stress (b) bottom stress
	due to water motion driven by a barotropic pressure gradient (c)
	bottom stress due to water motion in a bottom jet. It is shown that
	the predicted entrainment velocities are in good agreement with available
	laboratory data, provided the models have been calibrated according
	to a theoretical constraint. In addition, model behaviour in free
	convection is re-analysed with the help of recent data from large
	eddy simulations (LES). It is shown that even the most simple models,
	which do not solve a differential equation for the turbulent kinetic

	however, they fail completely in reproducing the correct budget of
	the TKE-balance. In contrast, second-order models solving transport

  number = {15},
  abstract = {Data are presented on long-term salinity behaviour in San Francisco
	Bay, California. A two-level, width averaged model of the tidally
	averaged salinity and circulation has been written in order to interpret
	the long-term (days to decades) salinity variability. The model has
	been used to simulate daily averaged salinity in the upper and lower
	levels of a 51 segment discretization of the Bay over the 22-yr period
	1967-1988. Monthly averaged surface salinity from observations and
	monthly-averaged simulated salinity are in reasonable agreement.
	Good agreement is obtained from comparison with daily averaged salinity
	measured in the upper reaches of North Bay. The salinity variability
	is driven primarily by freshwater inflow with relatively minor oceanic
	influence. All stations exhibit a marked seasonal cycle in accordance
	with the Mediterranean climate, as well as a rich spectrum of variability
	due to extreme inflow events and extended periods of drought. Monthly
	averaged salinity intrusion positions have a pronounced seasonal
	variability and show an approximately linear response to the logarithm
	of monthly averaged Delta inflow. Although few observed data are
	available for studies of long-term salinity stratification, modelled
	stratification is found to be strongly dependent on freshwater inflow;
	the nature of that dependence varies throughout the Bay. Near the
	Golden Gate, stratification tends to increase up to very high inflows.
	In the central reaches of North Bay, modelled stratification maximizes
	as a function of inflow and further inflow reduces stratification.
	Near the head of North Bay, lowest summer inflows are associated
	with the greatest modelled stratification. Observations from the
	central reaches of North Bay show marked spring-neap variations in
	stratification and gravitational circulation, both being stronger
	at neap tides. This spring-neap variation is simulated by the model.
	A feature of the modelled stratification is a hysteresis in which,
	for a given spring-neap tidal range and fairly steady inflows, the
	stratification is higher progressing from neaps to springs than from
	springs to neaps. The simulated responses of the Bay to perturbations
	in coastal sea salinity and Delta inflow have been used to further
	delineate the time-scales of salinity variability. Simulations have
	been performed about low inflow, steady-state conditions for both
	salinity and Delta inflow perturbations. For salinity perturbations
	a small, sinusoidal salinity signal with a period of 1 yr has been
	applied at the coastal boundary as well as a pulse of salinity with
	a duration of one day. For Delta inflow perturbations a small, sinusoidally
	varying inflow signal with a period of 1 yr has been superimposed
	on an otherwise constant Delta inflow, as well as a pulse of inflow
	with a duration of one day. Perturbations in coastal salinity dissipate
	as they move through the Bay. Seasonal perturbations require about
	40--45 days to propagate from the coastal ocean to the Delta and
	to the head of South Bay. The response times of the model to perturbations
	in freshwater inflow are faster than this in North Bay and comparable
	in South Bay. In North Bay, time-scales are},

  abstract = {It is competition between the various stratifying and mixing influences
	which determines the character of stratification in an estuary. Borrowing
	concepts which have been successfully applied to the discussion of
	stratification in shelf seas, a quantitative basis for determining
	the potential energy associated with vertical structure in estuaries
	is derived. The formulation, along similar lines to that of Bowden
	(1981), provides a simple but comprehensive method of incorporating
	many relevant stratifying and mixing influences in a given problem,
	and is also shown to be capable of rearrangement into forms akin
	to the estuarine Richardson number which is commonly found in discussions
	of estuarine statification. The paper argues, based on a survey of
	the literature, that in wide, relatively well-mixed estuaries, the
	greatest longitudinal mass flux occurs at times when stratification
	is most developed, that is, when the turbulent kinetic energy in
	the water column is at a minimum. Modulation of turbulence, principally
	at various tidal frequencies, causes a pulsing of the mass flux in
	which the contribution of each pulse increases non-linearly as the
	period of the modulation increases. Some, possibly significant, changes
	to the state of stratification and to the corresponding mass transport
	may occur in association with slack water periods. However, the spring-neap
	cycle is proposed to have a far greater influence on stratification,
	mass transport and the long-term mass balance in estuaries, and recent
	observational studies lend support to this position.},

  abstract = {Conceptual models for tidal period and low-frequency variations in
	sea level, currents, and mixing processes in the northern and southern
	reaches of San Francisco Bay describe the contrasting characteristics
	and dissimilar processes and rates in these embayments: The northern
	reach is a partially mixed estuary whereas the southern reach (South
	Bay) is a tidally oscillating lagoon with density-driven exchanges
	with the northern reach. The mixed semidiurnal tides are mixtures
	of progressive and standing waves. The relatively simple oscillations
	in South Bay are nearly standing waves, with energy propagating down
	the channels and dispersing into the broad shoal areas. The tides
	of the northern reach have the general properties of a progressive
	wave but are altered at the constriction of the embayments and gradually
	change in an upstream direction to a mixture of progressive and standing
	waves. The spring and neap variations of the tides are pronounced
	and cause fortnightly varying tidal currents that affect mixing and
	salinity stratification in the water column. Wind stress on the water
	surface, freshwater inflow, and tidal currents interacting with the
	complex bay configuration are the major local forcing mechanisms
	creating low-frequency variations in sea level and currents. These
	local forcing mechanisms drive the residual flows which, with tidal
	diffusion, control the water-replacement rates in the estuary. In
	the northern reach, the longitudinal density gradient drives an estuarine
	circulation in the channels, and the spatial variation in tidal amplitude
	creates a tidally-driven residual circulation. In contrast, South
	Bay exhibits a balance between wind-driven circulation and tidallydriven
	residual circulation for most of the year. During winter, however,
	there can be sufficient density variations to drive multilayer (2
	to 3) flows in the channel of South Bay. Mixing models (that include
	both diffusive and dispersive processes) are based on time scales
	associated with salt variations at the boundaries and those associated
	with the local forcing mechanisms, while the spatial scales of variations
	are dependent upon the configuration of the embayments. In the northern
	reach, where the estuarine circulation is strong, the salt flux is
	carried by the mean advection of the mean salt field. Where large
	salinity gradients are present, the tidal correlation part of the
	salt flux is of the same order as the advective part. Our knowledge
	of mixing and exchange rates in South Bay is poor. As this embayment
	is nearly isohaline, the salt flux is dominated entirely by the mean
	advection of the mean salt field. During and after peaks in river
	discharge, water mixing becomes more dynamic, with a strong density-driven
	current creating a net exchange of both water mass and salt. These
	exchanges are stronger during neap tides. Residence times of the
	water masses vary seasonally and differ between reaches. In the northern
	reach, residence times are on the order of days for high winter river
	discharge and of months for summer periods. The residence times for
	South Bay are fairly long (on the order of several months) during
	summer, and typically shorter (less than a month) during winter when
	density-driven exchanges occur.},

	proposed by Umlauf and Burchard [J. Marine Research 61 (2003) 235]
	is implemented in a three-dimensional oceanographic model (Regional
	Oceanographic Modeling System; ROMS v2.0). These two equations, along
	with several stability functions, can represent many popular turbulence
	closures, including the k-kl (Mellor-Yamada Level 2.5), k-e, and
	k-x schemes. The implementation adds flexibility to the model by
	providing an unprecedented range of turbulence closure selections

	of turbulence models in an otherwise identical numerical environment.
	This also allows evaluation of the effect of turbulence models on
	other processes such as suspended-sediment distribution or ecological
	processes. Performance of the turbulence models and sediment-transport
	schemes is investigated with three test cases for (1) steady barotropic
	flow in a rectangular channel, (2) wind-induced surface mixed-layer
	deepening in a stratified fluid, and (3) oscillatory stratified pressure-gradient
	driven flow (estuarine circulation) in a rectangular channel. Results

	[J. Marine Research 61 (2003) 235]) are very similar for these cases,

	that must be chosen to suit the flow. Greater variations appear in
	simulations of suspended-sediment concentrations than in salinity
	simulations because the transport of suspended-sediment amplifies
	minor variations in the methods. The amplification is caused by the
	added physics of a vertical settling rate, bottom stress dependent

	The resulting information, such as storage time, velocity distribution,
	and distribution of the diffusivity has been implemented into the
	LPTM. The method has been tested by comparing the results of the
	simulation with analytical solutions to the one-dimensional advection-diffusion
	equation. It could be shown that in the presence of large dead water
	zones at the river banks, an equilibrium between longitudinal shear
	and transverse diffusion can be reached if the morphologic conditions
	do not change. The simulations are leading asymptotically to a Gaussian
	distribution of the cross sectional averaged concentration in longitudinal
	direction. The transport velocity resulting from LPTM corresponds
	to the transport velocity predicted by the one-dimensional dead-zone-model
	only for certain geometrical conditions, which correspond to a fixed

  abstract = {Spatio-temporal statistical models are increasingly being used across
	a wide variety of scientific disciplines to describe and predict
	spatially-explicit processes that evolve over time. Correspondingly,
	in recent years there has been a significant amount of research on
	new statistical methodology for such models. Although descriptive
	models that approach the problem from the second-order (covariance)
	perspective are important, and innovative work is being done in this
	regard, many real-world processes are dynamic, and it can be more
	efficient in some cases to characterize the associated spatio-temporal
	dependence by the use of dynamical models. The chief challenge with
	the specification of such dynamical models has been related to the
	curse of dimensionality. Even in fairly simple linear, first-order
	Markovian, Gaussian error settings, statistical models are often
	over parameterized. Hierarchical models have proven invaluable in
	their ability to deal to some extent with this issue by allowing
	dependency among groups of parameters. In addition, this framework
	has allowed for the specification of science based parameterizations
	(and associated prior distributions) in which classes of deterministic
	dynamical models (e.g., partial differential equations (PDEs), integro-difference
	equations (IDEs), matrix models, and agent-based models) are used
	to guide specific parameterizations. Most of the focus for the application
	of such models in statistics has been in the linear case. The problems
	mentioned above with linear dynamic models are compounded in the
	case of nonlinear models. In this sense, the need for coherent and
	sensible model parameterizations is not only helpful, it is essential.
	Here, we present an overview of a framework for incorporating scientific
	information to motivate dynamical spatio-temporal models. First,
	we illustrate the methodology with the linear case. We then develop
	a general nonlinear spatio-temporal framework that we call general
	quadratic nonlinearity and demonstrate that it accommodates many
	different classes of scientific-based parameterizations as special
	cases. The model is presented in a hierarchical Bayesian framework
	and is illustrated with examples from ecology and oceanography. },

	of the rate of production of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is proportional
	to the cube of the velocity standard deviation. For stronger flows,
	the principal determining parameter is the number of individual independent

	less than the autocovariance time scale of the turbulence. Using
	the fast ping rate, the uncertainty in the Reynolds stress due to
