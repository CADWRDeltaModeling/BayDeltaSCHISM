A time history or ".th" file is used to store boundary data. The SCHISM format uses elapsed time in seconds, but our files generally have dates in the left column in ISO format: e.g., 2009-02-10T00:00

flux.th: discharge into open boundaries in cms.
SAL_1.th: salinity at inflow boundaries in psu
TEM_1.th: temperature at inflow boundaries in degrees celsius
oldr_head_weir.th: This and other gates that have time histories are stored in the appropriate hydraulic structure format.
