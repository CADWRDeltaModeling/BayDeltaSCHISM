Tutorials
`Hello SCHISM tutorials <https://cadwrdeltamodeling.github.io/HelloSCHISM/html/index.html>`_ are a set of SCHISM tutorials that introduce basic features, our preprocessors and can get you running the model quickly (Windows friendly).

`Hello SCHISM tutorials <https://cadwrdeltamodeling.github.io/HelloSCHISM/html/index.html>`_ using a simple, contrived domain and associated tutorials. 

:doc:`Bay-Delta Tutorials <bay_delta_tutorials>` and presentations describe model assumptions and model input preparation for Bay-Delta SCHISM.

:doc:`Linux hints <linux>` for archiving runs

Manuals
-------

`SCHISM Manuals <http://ccrm.vims.edu/schismweb/schism_manual.html>`_ are available for SCHISM at the VIMS site.

`schimpy user guide and API documentation <https://cadwrdeltamodeling.github.io/schimpy/html/index.html>`_ describe our preprocessors for grids and spatial inputs.

Bay-Delta Modeling Topical Guide
********************************

The following topic guides take you through what it takes to set up a basic model run using the Bay-Delta SCHISM toolchain. You won't have action items on all the topics for every run, but you should learn generally about the items and where the 'gotchas' are. It is also useful to familiarize yourself with these and other utilities. Or ask us -- we would much rather see an existing utility get better used and refined than have the same tool get reinvented many times.
