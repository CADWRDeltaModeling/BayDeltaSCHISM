This is the most basic template for the full bay_delta. At this point having this in GitHub is still a work in progress. No warrantee is made (yet) that the templates machh our studies ... we  are working towards that.  The template still requires some additional coaching and instruuction, but we'll write it up and put it here and/or in the repository wiki

The template is based on version 90e of the mesh. It should work through at least 95. Note that early instructions included how to clip out the American River, but this capability is proving to be more trouble than it is worth so we won't be actively using it (you would need to adjust open boundaries yaml file).
